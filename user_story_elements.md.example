# Novel Concept
**Title**: Chronoscape Drifters
**Genre**: Time-Travel Adventure with Noir elements
**Theme**: The malleability of history and personal identity
**Logline**: [Fill-in]

# Protagonist
**Name**: Jax Xenobia
**Description**: A jaded ex-temporal agent, haunted by a past mission where a timeline he was supposed to protect fractured catastrophically. He now runs a dusty antique shop in a forgotten eddy of spacetime, trying to escape his memories.
**Character Arc**: From a guilt-ridden recluse to reluctantly accepting his unique ability to perceive 'temporal echoes' of altered events, ultimately confronting the source of the original fracture.
**Traits**:
- Perceptive (especially to temporal anomalies)
- Witty (sarcastic)
- Resourceful
- [Fill-in]
**Initial Status**: Hiding from his past, owner of 'The Hourglass Curios'.
**Relationships**:
  **Lila**: Former partner, presumed lost in the timeline fracture.
  **The Fixer**: Mysterious contact who pulls Jax back into temporal affairs.

# Antagonist
**Name**: Cohort Zero (collective consciousness)
**Description**: An entity from a potential future that believes stabilizing all timelines into one "optimal" path is necessary, even if it means erasing countless others. Appears as shifting, glitch-like figures.
**Motivations**: To prevent a prophesied "Grand Collapse" by imposing absolute order across all of history.

# Conflict
**Summary**: Jax is drawn back into the high-stakes game of temporal manipulation when echoes of his failed mission begin to resurface, threatening his hideaway reality. He must team up with new (and old) allies to stop Cohort Zero from "sanitizing" history, all while battling his own demons and the temptation to alter his personal past.
**Inciting Incident**: An antique device in Jax's shop activates, showing a vivid temporal echo of Lila moments before her disappearance, an echo that shouldn't exist.
**Climax Event Preview**: [Fill-in]

# Plot Points
<!-- Provide as many plot points as you like. SAGA aims for about 12 total. -->
- Jax experiences the anomalous echo and is contacted by The Fixer.

# Setting
**Primary Setting Description**: A multiverse of intersecting timelines, policed (loosely) by various temporal agencies. Key locations include 'Temporal Hubs' (stable nexus points), 'Fracture Zones' (chaotic, unstable realities), and 'Eddy Realities' (isolated, slow-time pockets like Jax's shop).
**Key Locations**:
  **The Hourglass Curios**:
    **Description**: Jax's antique shop, located in an Eddy Reality. Appears normal but contains artifacts from countless timelines.
    **Atmosphere**: Dusty, quiet, filled with the scent of old paper and ozone. A sanctuary that is not as safe as Jax believes.
  **Temporal Hub Prime**:
    **Description**: A vast, crystalline city existing outside normal spacetime, headquarters of the (now largely defunct) Temporal Concord.
    **Atmosphere**: Once bustling and sterile, now largely abandoned and echoing with past glories.
  **The Shifting Sands (Fracture Zone)**:
    **Description**: [Fill-in]
    **Atmosphere**: [Fill-in]

# World Details
**Unique World Feature**: Temporal Echoes
  **Description**: Residual psychic and environmental imprints left by significant timeline alterations or strong emotional events. Jax is uniquely sensitive to them.
  **Rules**:
    - Echoes are fragmented and often misleading.
    - Prolonged exposure can cause disorientation or 'chronal sickness'.
    - Only few individuals can perceive them.
**Key Factions**:
  **The Chronos Wardens (Remnants of Temporal Concord)**:
    **Description**: A scattered group trying to uphold the old laws of non-interference, often clashing with Cohort Zero.
    **Goals**:
      - Preserve timeline integrity (as they see it).
      - Recruit individuals like Jax.
  **Cohort Zero**:
    **Description**: (See Antagonist section)
    **Goals**:
      - Achieve the "Optimal Timeline".
      - Eliminate rogue elements and unpredictable variables (like Jax).
**Relevant Lore**:
  **The Great Timeline Fracture**:
    **Description**: The catastrophic event from Jax's past. Details are hazy and suppressed by temporal authorities.
    **Known Effects**: Caused numerous Eddy Realities to form; source of Jax's trauma.

# Other Key Characters
  **The Fixer**:
    **Description**: An enigmatic information broker who operates across timelines. Gender and appearance seem to shift.
