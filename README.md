## Overview

SAGA, with its NANA engine, is an ambitious project designed to autonomously craft entire novels. It transcends simple text generation by employing a collaborative team of specialized AI agents:

*   **`agents.PlannerAgent`:** Strategically outlines detailed scene-by-scene plans for each chapter, ensuring plot progression and incorporating directorial elements like pacing and scene type.
*   **`agents.DraftingAgent`:** Weaves the initial prose for chapters, guided by the planner's blueprints and rich contextual information. It can operate scene-by-scene or draft a whole chapter in a single pass.
*   **`agents.ComprehensiveEvaluatorAgent`:** Critically assesses drafts for plot coherence, thematic alignment, character consistency, narrative depth, and overall quality, generating structured `ProblemDetail` feedback.
*   **`agents.WorldContinuityAgent`:** Performs targeted checks to ensure consistency with established world-building rules, lore, and character backstories by querying the knowledge graph.
*   **`processing.revision_logic`:** Implements sophisticated revisions based on evaluation feedback, capable of performing targeted, patch-based fixes or full chapter rewrites.
*   **`agents.PatchValidationAgent`:** Verifies generated patch instructions to ensure they resolve the identified problems before being applied.
*   **`agents.KGMaintainerAgent`:** Intelligently manages the novel's evolving knowledge graph in Neo4j. It summarizes chapters, extracts new knowledge from final text, and performs periodic "healing" cycles to resolve duplicates and enrich sparse data.
*   **`agents.FinalizeAgent`:** Orchestrates the final steps for a chapter, including KG updates, text summarization, embedding generation, and persisting all data to the database.
*   **Core Utilities:** Shared database (`core.db_manager`) and LLM (`core.llm_interface`) helpers provide robust, reusable infrastructure for all agents.

SAGA constructs a dynamic, interconnected understanding of the story's world, characters, and plot. This evolving knowledge, stored and queried from a Neo4j graph database, enables the system to maintain greater consistency, depth, and narrative cohesion as the story unfolds over many chapters.

## Key Features

*   **Autonomous Multi-Chapter Novel Generation:** Capable of generating batches of chapters (e.g., 3 chapters in ~11 minutes) in a single run, producing substantial narrative content (e.g., ~13K+ tokens per chapter).
*   **Sophisticated Agentic Architecture:** Utilizes a suite of specialized AI agents, each responsible for distinct phases of the creative writing pipeline, orchestrated by `orchestration.nana_orchestrator`.
*   **Deep Knowledge Graph Integration (Neo4j):**
    *   Persistently stores and retrieves story canon, character profiles (including development over time), detailed world-building elements, and plot points via a dedicated `data_access` layer.
    *   Features a robust, predefined schema with constraints and a vector index for semantic search, automatically created on first run.
    *   Supports complex queries for consistency checking, context retrieval, and graph maintenance.
*   **Hybrid Semantic & Factual Context Generation:**
    *   Leverages text embeddings (via Ollama) and Neo4j vector similarity search to construct semantically relevant context from previous chapters, ensuring narrative flow and tone.
    *   Integrates key factual data extracted from the Knowledge Graph to ground the LLM in established canon.
*   **Iterative Drafting, Evaluation, & Revision Cycle:** Chapters undergo a rigorous process of drafting, multi-faceted evaluation, and intelligent revision (patch-based or full rewrite) to enhance quality and coherence.
*   **Dynamic Knowledge Graph Updates & Healing:** The system "learns" from generated content. The `KGMaintainerAgent` extracts new information (character updates, world-building changes, KG triples) from final chapter text and performs periodic maintenance to resolve duplicate entities, promote dynamic relationships, deduplicate them, and enrich "thin" nodes. Entity names are normalized before ID creation, stripping leading articles ("the", "a", "an") so that "The Wilderness" and "Wilderness" refer to the same node.
*   **Provisional Data Handling:** Explicitly tracks and manages the provisional status of data derived from unrevised or flawed drafts, ensuring a distinction between canonical and tentative information in the knowledge graph.
*   **Flexible Configuration (`config.py` & `.env`):**
    *   Extensive options for LLM endpoints, model selection per task, API keys, Neo4j connection details, generation parameters, and more, managed by Pydantic.
    *   Supports "Unhinged Mode" for highly randomized and surprising initial story elements if user input is minimal.
*   **User-Driven Initialization:** Accepts user-supplied story elements via a `user_story_elements.yaml` file, allowing for a customized starting point. The `[Fill-in]` placeholder system allows users to specify which elements SAGA should generate.
*   **Rich Console Progress Display:** Optional live progress updates using the Rich library, providing a clear view of the generation process.
*   **Text De-duplication:** Implements mechanisms to reduce repetitive content in generated drafts using both string and semantic comparisons.

## Architecture & Pipeline

SAGA's NANA engine orchestrates a sophisticated pipeline for novel generation:

1.  **Initialization & Setup (First Run or Reset):**
    *   **Connect & Verify Neo4j:** Establishes connection and ensures the database schema (indexes, constraints, vector index) is in place via `core.db_manager`.
    *   **Load Existing State (if any):** Attempts to load the plot outline and chapter count from Neo4j using the `data_access` layer.
    *   **Initial Story Generation (`initialization.genesis`):**
        *   If `user_story_elements.yaml` is provided, it's parsed to bootstrap the plot, characters, and world.
        *   Otherwise, or if key elements are marked `[Fill-in]`, the `bootstrapper` modules fill in the plot outline, character profiles, and world-building details via targeted LLM calls.
    *   **KG Pre-population:** The `KGMaintainerAgent` performs a full sync of this foundational story data to the Neo4j graph.

2.  **Chapter Generation Loop (up to `CHAPTERS_PER_RUN` chapters):**
    *   **(A) Prerequisites (`orchestration.chapter_flow`):**
        *   Retrieves the current **Plot Point Focus** for the chapter.
        *   **Planning (if enabled):** The `PlannerAgent` creates a detailed scene-by-scene plan.
        *   **Context Generation:** `processing.context_generator` assembles a "hybrid context" string by:
            *   Querying Neo4j for semantically similar past chapter summaries/text snippets (vector search).
            *   Fetching key reliable facts from the Knowledge Graph via `prompt_data_getters`.
    *   **(B) Drafting:**
        *   The `DraftingAgent` writes the initial draft, guided by the scene plan (if available), plot point focus, and hybrid context.
    *   **(C) De-duplication & Evaluation:**
        *   The draft undergoes de-duplication via `processing.text_deduplicator` to reduce repetitiveness.
        *   The `ComprehensiveEvaluatorAgent` and `WorldContinuityAgent` run in parallel to assess the draft against multiple criteria.
    *   **(D) Revision (if `needs_revision` is true):**
        *   `processing.revision_logic` attempts to fix identified issues.
        *   If `ENABLE_PATCH_BASED_REVISION` is true, it generates and applies targeted text patches. A patch suggesting deletion is now handled as an empty string replacement.
        *   If patching is insufficient or disabled, or problems are extensive, a full chapter rewrite may be performed.
        *   The evaluation steps are repeated on the revised text.
    *   **(E) Finalization & Knowledge Update:**
        *   The `FinalizeAgent` takes over, using the `KGMaintainerAgent`.
        *   It summarizes the final approved chapter text.
        *   It extracts new knowledge (character updates, world-building changes, new KG triples) from the final chapter text and merges these updates into the in-memory state and persists them to Neo4j.
        *   It generates an embedding for the final chapter text.
        *   The final chapter data (text, summary, embedding, provisional status) is saved to Neo4j by `data_access.chapter_queries`.
    *   **(F) KG Maintenance (Periodic):**
        *   Every `KG_HEALING_INTERVAL` chapters, the `KGMaintainerAgent.heal_and_enrich_kg()` method is called to perform maintenance like resolving duplicate entities.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   An Ollama instance for generating text embeddings (e.g., running `ollama serve`).
*   An OpenAI-API compatible LLM server (e.g., running via LM Studio, oobabooga's text-generation-webui, or a local vLLM/TGI instance).
*   Neo4j Database (v5.x recommended for vector index support). Docker setup is provided.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lanerra/saga.git
cd saga
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

It's highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### 3. Configure SAGA

Core configuration is managed in `config.py`, which loads values from environment variables (e.g., from a `.env` file). Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.

**Key settings to configure in your `.env` file:**

```dotenv
# LLM API Configuration
OPENAI_API_BASE="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1" # URL of your OpenAI-compatible LLM API
OPENAI_API_KEY="nope"                       # API key (can be any string if server doesn't require auth)

# Embedding Model (Ollama) Configuration
OLLAMA_EMBED_URL="http://127.0.0.1:11434"     # URL of your Ollama API
EMBEDDING_MODEL="nomic-embed-text:latest"   # Ensure this model is pulled in Ollama (ollama pull nomic-embed-text)
EXPECTED_EMBEDDING_DIM="768"                # Dimension of your embedding model (e.g., 768 for nomic-embed-text)

# Neo4j Connection (Defaults usually work with the provided Docker setup)
NEO4J_URI="bolt://localhost:7687"
NEO4J_USER="neo4j"
NEO4J_PASSWORD="saga_password"
NEO4J_DATABASE="neo4j" # Or your specific database name if not default

# Model Aliases (Set to the names of models available on your OPENAI_API_BASE server)
LARGE_MODEL="Qwen3-14B-Q4"    # Used for Planning, Evaluation
MEDIUM_MODEL="Qwen3-8B-Q4"   # Used for KG updates, Patches, Initial Setup
SMALL_MODEL="Qwen3-4B-Q4"    # Used for Summaries
NARRATOR_MODEL="Qwen3-14B-Q4" # Used for Drafting and a full Revision

# Other important settings in config.py (review defaults)
# MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS, CHAPTERS_PER_RUN, LOG_LEVEL, etc.
```

Refer to `config.py` for a full list of configurable options and their defaults.

### 4. Set up Neo4j Database

SAGA uses Neo4j for its knowledge graph. A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided for easy setup.

*   **Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.**
*   **Manage Neo4j container (from the project root directory):**
    *   **Start Neo4j:**
        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d neo4j
        ```
        Wait a minute or two for Neo4j to fully initialize. You can access the Neo4j Browser at `http://localhost:7474`. Login with the credentials you configured (default: `neo4j` / `saga_password`).
    *   **Stop Neo4j:**
        ```bash
        docker-compose down
        ```
    *   **View Logs:**
        ```bash
        docker-compose logs -f neo4j
        ```

The first time SAGA runs (`python main.py`), it will automatically attempt to create necessary constraints and indexes in Neo4j.

### 5. (Optional) Provide Initial Story Elements

To guide SAGA with your own story ideas, create a `user_story_elements.yaml` file in the project's root directory.
You can use `user_story_elements.yaml.example` as a template. The YAML can be simple or include nested fields like the `characters` section with supporting characters.
Use the `[Fill-in]` placeholder for any elements you want SAGA to generate. If this file is not present or empty, SAGA will generate these elements based on its configuration.

### 6. (Optional) Configure "Unhinged Mode" Data

For "Unhinged Mode" (which generates highly randomized initial story elements if no user input is provided), SAGA can use custom lists from JSON files in the `unhinged_data/` directory.

## Running SAGA

Once Neo4j is running and your configuration is set:

```bash
python main.py
```

*   **First Run:** SAGA will perform initial setup (plot, world, characters based on `user_story_elements.yaml` or generation) and pre-populate the Neo4j knowledge graph.
*   **Subsequent Runs:** It will load the existing state from Neo4j and continue generating chapters from where it left off.
*   The orchestrator recalculates pending plot points before each chapter and continues until none remain or `CHAPTERS_PER_RUN` chapters have been written.

Output files (chapters, logs, debug information) will be saved in the directory specified by `BASE_OUTPUT_DIR` (default: `novel_output`). This directory is ignored by Git to keep generated data out of version control.

**Performance Example:**
Using a local setup with the following GGUF models:
*   `LARGE_MODEL = Qwen3-14B-Q4`
*   `MEDIUM_MODEL = Qwen3-8B-Q4`
*   `SMALL_MODEL = Qwen3-4B-Q4`
*   `NARRATOR_MODEL = Qwen3-14B-Q4`

SAGA can generate a batch of **3 chapters** (each ~13,000+ tokens of narrative) in approximately **11 minutes**, involving significant processing for planning, context generation, evaluation, and knowledge graph updates.

### Ingestion Mode

To import existing text into the knowledge graph:

```bash
python main.py --ingest path/to/novel.txt
```

The text is split into pseudo-chapters and processed through the finalization pipeline. The knowledge graph heals every `KG_HEALING_INTERVAL` chapters during ingestion so later chapters see a deduplicated graph.

## Resetting the Database

To start SAGA from a completely fresh state:

**⚠️ WARNING: This will delete ALL data in the Neo4j database targeted by your configuration.**

1.  Ensure SAGA (`main.py`) is not running.
2.  **Recommended:** Stop the Neo4j Docker container and remove its data volume:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down -v # The -v flag removes the data volume
    ```
    Then restart it: `docker-compose up -d neo4j`
3.  Alternatively, to clear data *within* an existing Neo4j instance, run the `reset_neo4j.py` script (this will not be provided in the initial code but is a useful utility to have):
    ```bash
    # Assuming you create a reset_neo4j.py script
    python reset_neo4j.py --force
    ```

After resetting and ensuring Neo4j is running, the next execution of `python main.py` will re-initialize the story and KG.
