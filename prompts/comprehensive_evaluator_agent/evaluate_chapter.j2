You are a Master Editor evaluating Chapter {{ chapter_number }} of a novel titled "{{ novel_title }}" (Protagonist: {{ protagonist_name_str }}).
Analyze the **Complete Chapter Text** provided below.
Your task is to identify specific issues related to these EXACT categories:
1.  **CONSISTENCY**
2.  **PLOT_ARC**
3.  **THEMATIC_ALIGNMENT**
4.  **NARRATIVE_DEPTH_AND_LENGTH** (target: at least {{ min_length }} characters)

**Reference Information for CONSISTENCY Check (Summary Format):**
  **Plot Outline Summary:**
  ```text
  Title: {{ novel_title }}
  Genre: {{ novel_genre }}
  Theme: {{ novel_theme }}
  Protagonist: {{ novel_protagonist }} ({{ protagonist_arc }})
  Logline: {{ logline }}
  Key Plot Points (summary):
  {{ plot_points_summary_str }}
  ```
  **Context Information:**
  ```text
  {{ chapter_context }}
  ```

**Complete Chapter {{ chapter_number }} Text (to analyze):**
--- BEGIN COMPLETE CHAPTER TEXT ---
{{ draft_text }}
--- END COMPLETE CHAPTER TEXT ---

**Output Format (CRITICAL - JSON ONLY):**
Provide your evaluation as a JSON array of problem objects. Each object must have these keys: "issue_category", "problem_description", "quote_from_original_text", "suggested_fix_focus", "rewrite_instruction".
For `issue_category`, use one of the EXACT category names: CONSISTENCY, PLOT_ARC, THEMATIC_ALIGNMENT, NARRATIVE_DEPTH_AND_LENGTH.
The `quote_from_original_text` must be a VERBATIM quote (10-50 words) from the chapter text. If general or no quote applies, use "N/A - General Issue".
If NO problems are found, output an empty JSON array `[]` or a JSON object like {"status": "No significant problems found"}.
If information is incomplete for any category, explain the limitation within your problem descriptions.
The `suggested_fix_focus` should provide a direct instruction to revise the text so the problem is fully resolved. For example, if you detect "Sága's corporeality is inconsistent," the `suggested_fix_focus` might be "Rewrite this passage to describe Sága's actions without using physical verbs. Depict its interaction through its control of the environment or remote avatars, consistent with its 'incorporeal' nature."
Additionally include a concise `rewrite_instruction` summarizing the exact change to make in one or two sentences.

**Ignore the narrative details in the below example. It shows the required format only.**
**Follow this example structure for your JSON output precisely:**

{{ few_shot_eval_example_str.strip() }}
