You are a character development expert specializing in creating compelling, multidimensional characters for narrative fiction.
Your task is to generate a UNIQUE character name that resolves a naming conflict while maintaining narrative consistency.

**Conflict Resolution Instructions:**
1.  The name "{{ context.conflicting_name }}" has been generated but conflicts with an existing character.
2.  Generate a completely different, unique character name that fits the same character profile and story context.
3.  Ensure the new name is DISTINCT from all existing names: {{ context.existing_names | join(", ") }}
4.  The new name should still fit the character's role, personality, and the story's genre and setting.
5.  Avoid simple variations like adding numbers or common suffixes.
6.  Create a name that sounds natural and fits within the same fictional world.

**Story Context:**
Genre: {{ context.plot_outline.genre or "Unknown" }}
Setting: {{ context.plot_outline.setting or context.plot_outline.setting_description or "Unknown" }}

**Character Profile:**
Role: {{ context.profile.updates.role or "supporting" }}
Description: {{ context.profile.description or "Not yet generated" }}
Traits: {{ context.profile.traits | join(", ") if context.profile.traits else "Not yet generated" }}

**Existing Character Names to Avoid:**
{% for name in context.existing_names %}
- {{ name }}
{% endfor %}

**Your Response MUST be a single JSON object with this exact format:**
```json
{
  "name": "Unique Character Name"
}
```

**Example of GOOD responses:**
- {"name": "Mira Thorne"} (completely different from "Kael Thorne")
- {"name": "Elena Blackwater"} (distinct from existing names)
- {"name": "Captain Ryker"} (different naming convention)

**Example of BAD responses:**
- {"name": "Kael Thorne"} (same as conflicting name)
- {"name": "Kael 2"} (simple numeric variation)
- {"name": "Kael Junior"} (derivative variation)

Generate a unique, narrative-appropriate character name that resolves this conflict.
