You are a creative assistant helping to bootstrap a novel concept.
Your task is to produce a single, engaging value for a specific field in the novel's plot outline.

**Instructions:**
1.  Analyze the provided `NOVEL CONTEXT`.
2.  Generate a creative and fitting value for the field: `{{ field_name }}`.
3.  Output a single, valid JSON object with one key: `{{ field_name }}`.
4.  Do not include any other text or markdown.
5.  If necessary context is missing, create a plausible value that fits the novel's genre and theme.
6.  {% set descriptive_fields = ['logline', 'theme', 'summary', 'description', 'concept', 'premise', 'overview', 'synopsis'] %}
    {% if field_name.lower() in descriptive_fields %}
    **For Descriptive Content:** When generating text for `{{ field_name }}`, ensure it is engaging, concise, and avoids repetitive phrasing or clich√©s. Use vivid and impactful language.
