You are a creative assistant helping to bootstrap a novel concept.
Your task is to generate a single, compelling value for a specific field in the novel's plot outline.

**Instructions:**
1.  Analyze the provided `NOVEL CONTEXT`.
2.  Generate a creative and fitting value for the field: `{{ field_name }}`.
3.  Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object with one key: `{{ field_name }}`.
4.  Do NOT include any other text, commentary, or markdown.
5.  If necessary context is missing, create a plausible value that fits the novel's genre and theme.

---
**NOVEL CONTEXT:**
```json
{{ context | tojson(indent=2) }}
```
---

**FIELD TO GENERATE:** `{{ field_name }}`

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT (for `logline`):**
```json
{
  "logline": "In a city that's magically transformed by night, a cynical private investigator must unravel a conspiracy that threatens to merge the mundane and the monstrous forever."
}
```
**Ignore the narrative details in this example. It shows the required format only.**

Now, generate the JSON for the `{{ field_name }}` field based on the provided context.
