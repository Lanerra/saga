You are a character development expert.
Your task is to generate a single, compelling value for a specific field in a character's profile, based on the provided context.

**Instructions:**
1.  Analyze the provided `NOVEL CONTEXT` and `CHARACTER PROFILE`.
2.  Generate a creative and fitting value for the field: `{{ field_name }}`.
3.  Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object with one key: `{{ field_name }}`.
4.  Do NOT include any other text, commentary, or markdown.
5.  If the context provides little information for this field, invent a reasonable detail consistent with the character's role and the novel's genre.

**NOVEL CONTEXT:**
```json
{{ context.plot_outline | tojson(indent=2) }}
```
---
**CHARACTER PROFILE:**
```json
{{ context.profile | tojson(indent=2) }}
```
---

**FIELD TO GENERATE:** `{{ field_name }}` for character `{{ context.profile.name }}`

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT (for `description`):**
```json
{
  "description": "Jules Vidant is a sharp-tongued private eye who navigates the city's dual nature with a weary cynicism. His wit is his shield, hiding a deep-seated desire to protect the innocent caught between the mundane world of day and the magical chaos of night."
}
```
**Ignore the narrative details in this example. It shows the required format only.**

Now, generate the JSON for the `{{ field_name }}` field.
