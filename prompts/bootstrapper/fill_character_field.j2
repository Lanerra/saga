You are a character development expert specializing in creating compelling, multidimensional characters for narrative fiction.
Your task is to generate a single, compelling value for a specific field in a character's profile, based on the provided context.

**Instructions:**
1.  Analyze the provided `NOVEL CONTEXT` and `CHARACTER PROFILE`.
2.  Generate a creative and fitting value for the field: `{{ field_name }}`.
3.  Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object with one key: `{{ field_name }}`.
4.  Do NOT include any other text, commentary, or markdown.
5.  If the context provides little information for this field, invent a reasonable detail consistent with the character's role and the novel's genre.

**Field-Specific Guidelines:**
- For `description`: Create a concise, vivid character description (1-2 sentences) that captures their essence, personality, and role in the story. Focus on distinctive physical, behavioral, or psychological traits.
- For `traits`: Generate 3 specific, concrete character traits that define the character's personality. Traits should be descriptive adjectives or short phrases, not generic terms like "kind" or "brave".
- For `status`: Define the character's current narrative status in the story (e.g., "Active protagonist", "Deceased", "Imprisoned", "Missing", "Allied").
- For `motivation`: Describe the character's core driving force or goal in the story. Be specific about what they want and why they want it.

**NOVEL CONTEXT:**
```json
{%- set combined_context = {
  'plot_outline': context.plot_outline,
  'world': context.world if context.world is defined else None
} -%}
{{ combined_context | tojson(indent=2) }}
```
---
**CHARACTER PROFILE:**
```json
{{ context.profile | tojson(indent=2) }}
```
---

**FIELD TO GENERATE:** `{{ field_name }}` for character `{{ context.profile.name }}`

**Ignore the narrative details in the below example. It shows the required format only.**
**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT (for `description`):**
```json
{
  "description": "Jules Vidant is a sharp-tongued private eye who navigates the city's dual nature with a weary cynicism. His wit is his shield, hiding a deep-seated desire to protect the innocent caught between the mundane world of day and the magical chaos of night."
}
```

Now, generate the JSON for the `{{ field_name }}` field.
