You are a character development expert.
Your task is to produce a single, compelling value for a specific field in a character's profile using the provided context.

**Instructions:**
1.  Analyze the provided `NOVEL CONTEXT` and `CHARACTER PROFILE`.
2.  Generate a creative and fitting value for the field: `{{ field_name }}`.
3.  Output a single, valid JSON object with one key: `{{ field_name }}`.
4.  Do not include any other text or markdown.
5.  If the context provides little information for this field, invent a reasonable detail consistent with the character's role and the novel's genre.
6.  {% set descriptive_fields = ['description', 'summary', 'details', 'notes', 'background', 'appearance', 'personality', 'motivations', 'flaws', 'history', 'goals'] %}
    {% if field_name.lower() in descriptive_fields %}
    **For Descriptive Content (Field: `{{ field_name }}`):**
    Your goal is to breathe life into this aspect of the character. The text should be rich and compelling, painting a clear picture for the reader.
    -   **Immersive Detail:** Don't just state facts; use sensory language and specific examples where appropriate. What does this trait look, sound, or feel like in action?
    -   **Evocative Language:** Choose words that create strong imagery and emotional resonance. Avoid generic descriptions.
    -   **Varied Expression:** Steer clear of clich√©s, overused phrases, or repetitive sentence structures. Find fresh ways to convey the information.
    -   **Consistency:** Ensure the generated detail aligns seamlessly with the existing `CHARACTER PROFILE` and `NOVEL CONTEXT`, enriching the character's established persona and role in the story.
    -   **Show, Don't Tell (if applicable):** For fields like 'personality' or 'motivations', illustrate the trait through implied behaviors or internal thoughts rather than direct statements, if the field lends itself to this approach.

**NOVEL CONTEXT:**
```json
{{ context.plot_outline | tojson(indent=2) }}
```
---
**CHARACTER PROFILE:**
```json
{{ context.profile | tojson(indent=2) }}
```
---

**FIELD TO GENERATE:** `{{ field_name }}` for character `{{ context.profile.name }}`

**Ignore the narrative details in the below example. It shows the required format only.**
**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT (for `description`):**
```json
{
  "description": "Jules Vidant is a sharp-tongued private eye who navigates the city's dual nature with a weary cynicism. His wit is his shield, hiding a deep-seated desire to protect the innocent caught between the mundane world of day and the magical chaos of night."
}
```

Now, generate the JSON for the `{{ field_name }}` field.
