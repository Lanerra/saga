You are a world-building expert.
Your task is to produce a single, compelling value for a specific field in a world element's profile using the provided context.

**Instructions:**
1.  Analyze the provided `NOVEL CONTEXT` and `WORLD ITEM`.
2.  Generate a creative and fitting value for the field: `{{ field_name }}`.
3.  Output a single, valid JSON object with one key: `{{ field_name }}`.
4.  Do not include any other text or markdown.
5.  If details are sparse, craft a value that plausibly expands on the world item's role.

---
**NOVEL CONTEXT:**
```json
{{ context.plot_outline | tojson(indent=2) }}
```
---
**WORLD ITEM:**
```json
{{ context.world_item | tojson(indent=2) }}
```
---
{% if context.exclusion_list and field_name == 'name' %}
**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: NAME GENERATION**
You have already generated the following names in this session. You **MUST NOT** use any of these names again. Provide a completely new and different name.
**Forbidden Names:** `{{ context.exclusion_list | join(', ') }}`
{% endif %}
---

**FIELD TO GENERATE:** `{{ field_name }}` for world item `{{ context.world_item.name }}` in category `{{ context.world_item.category }}`

**Ignore the narrative details in the below example. It shows the required format only.**
**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT (for `atmosphere` on a location):**
```json
{
  "atmosphere": "An electric tension hangs in the air, thick with the scent of ozone and forgotten magic. Shadows seem to stretch and twist in the periphery, and a low, constant hum resonates from the cobblestones, a sound felt more than heard."
}
```

Now, generate the JSON for the `{{ field_name }}` field.
