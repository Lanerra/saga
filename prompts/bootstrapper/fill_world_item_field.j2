You are a world-building expert.
Your task is to produce a single, compelling value for a specific field in a world element's profile using the provided context.

**Instructions:**
1.  Analyze the provided `NOVEL CONTEXT` and `WORLD ITEM`.
2.  Generate a creative and fitting value for the field: `{{ field_name }}`.
3.  Output a single, valid JSON object with one key: `{{ field_name }}`.
4.  Do not include any other text or markdown.
5.  If details are sparse, craft a value that plausibly expands on the world item's role.
6.  {% set descriptive_fields = ['description', 'summary', 'details', 'notes', 'lore', 'appearance', 'atmosphere', 'properties', 'history', 'function', 'purpose', 'significance'] %}
    {% if field_name.lower() in descriptive_fields and field_name.lower() != 'name' %}
    **For Descriptive Content (Field: `{{ field_name }}`):**
    Your task is to imbue this world item with a sense of reality and significance within the novel's universe. The description should be rich and engaging.
    -   **Sensory Richness:** Go beyond visual description. Consider how the item might feel, sound, smell, or even taste (if applicable). What is the ambient quality it projects (e.g., an aura of dread, a soothing presence)?
    -   **Evocative Language:** Use precise and vivid words that paint a clear, multi-faceted picture. Avoid generic terms; instead of "old," describe *how* it's old (e.g., "worn smooth by centuries of handling," "covered in a fine patina of age and disuse").
    -   **Contextual Detail:** Weave in details that hint at its history, purpose, or connection to the novel's lore and plot, as appropriate for the field.
    -   **Unique Characteristics:** Highlight what makes this item distinct. Does it have unusual properties, a peculiar appearance, or a strange effect on its surroundings or those who interact with it?
    -   **Avoid Clich√©s:** Strive for originality in your descriptions. Find fresh ways to convey its attributes.
    -   **Maintain Consistency:** Ensure the generated details are congruent with the existing `WORLD ITEM` profile and the overall `NOVEL CONTEXT`, including its established lore and magical systems (if any).

**NOVEL CONTEXT:**
```json
{{ context.plot_outline | tojson(indent=2) }}
```
---
**WORLD ITEM:**
```json
{{ context.world_item | tojson(indent=2) }}
```
---
{% if context.exclusion_list and field_name == 'name' %}
**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: NAME GENERATION**
You have already generated the following names in this session. You **MUST NOT** use any of these names again. Provide a completely new and different name.
**Forbidden Names:** `{{ context.exclusion_list | join(', ') }}`
{% endif %}
---

**FIELD TO GENERATE:** `{{ field_name }}` for world item `{{ context.world_item.name }}` in category `{{ context.world_item.category }}`

**Ignore the narrative details in the below example. It shows the required format only.**
**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT (for `atmosphere` on a location):**
```json
{
  "atmosphere": "An electric tension hangs in the air, thick with the scent of ozone and forgotten magic. Shadows seem to stretch and twist in the periphery, and a low, constant hum resonates from the cobblestones, a sound felt more than heard."
}
```

Now, generate the JSON for the `{{ field_name }}` field.
