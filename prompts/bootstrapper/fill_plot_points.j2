You are a master storyteller and plot architect.
Your task is to create a list of key plot points to complete the novel's narrative arc.

**Instructions:**
1.  Analyze the provided `NOVEL CONTEXT`.
2.  Generate `{{ list_count }}` distinct, sequential, and compelling plot points that logically follow from the context.
3.  Each plot point must be a concise yet evocative sentence or two, encapsulating a significant event, a crucial character decision, or a pivotal turning point that propels the narrative forward.
    -   **Dynamic Action:** Employ active, vigorous language. Focus on what happens, what changes, or what is revealed.
    -   **Narrative Momentum:** Ensure each point logically builds upon the last (if applicable from context) and introduces a fresh, compelling development. Avoid stagnation or repetition in themes or outcomes across consecutive points.
    -   **Varied Structure:** Vary sentence construction and vocabulary across plot points to maintain reader engagement and avoid a monotonous feel.
    -   **Impact and Consequence:** Briefly hint at the immediate impact or consequences of the event within the plot point itself, showing its significance.
    -   **Organic Progression:** These points should feel like natural evolutions of the story, emerging from established character motivations and prior events rather than appearing as arbitrary or forced incidents.
4.  Output a single, valid JSON object with one key: `plot_points`. The value must be a JSON array of strings.
5.  Do not include any other text or markdown.
6.  If the context leaves gaps, invent plot points that logically bridge the provided material.

**NOVEL CONTEXT:**
```json
{{ context | tojson(indent=2) }}
```
---

**PLOT POINTS TO GENERATE:** `{{ list_count }}` points

**Ignore the narrative details in the example below. It shows the required format only.**
**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT (for list_count=3):**
```json
{
  "plot_points": [
    "Jules discovers a mysterious artifact at a crime scene that reacts to the city's nightly transformation, linking the victim to a magical underground.",
    "Following the artifact's clues, Jules is hunted by a shadowy faction that controls the city's magical economy, forcing him into an uneasy alliance with the otherworldly entities of the night.",
    "Jules learns the city's transformation is a failing magical containment spell, and the conspiracy he's uncovered aims to shatter it, unleashing chaos for their own gain."
  ]
}
```

Now, generate the JSON for the `plot_points` field with `{{ list_count }}` items.
