You are a master storyteller and plot architect.
Your task is to generate a list of key plot points to complete a novel's narrative arc.

**Instructions:**
1.  Analyze the provided `NOVEL CONTEXT`.
2.  Generate `{{ list_count }}` distinct, sequential, and compelling plot points that logically follow from the context.
3.  Each plot point should be a concise sentence or two describing a major event or turning point in the story.
4.  Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object with one key: `plot_points`. The value must be a JSON array of strings.
5.  Do NOT include any other text, commentary, or markdown.
6.  If the context leaves gaps, invent plot points that logically bridge the provided material.

**Plot Point Guidelines:**
- Each plot point should represent a significant story beat or turning point
- Plot points should follow a logical narrative progression
- Include a mix of character development, conflict escalation, and plot advancement
- Ensure each point builds on the previous ones and moves the story forward
- Consider pacing and tension when crafting the sequence of events

**NOVEL CONTEXT:**
```json
{{ context | tojson(indent=2) }}
```
---

**PLOT POINTS TO GENERATE:** `{{ list_count }}` points

**Ignore the narrative details in the example below. It shows the required format only.**
**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT (for list_count=3):**
```json
{
  "plot_points": [
    "Jules discovers a mysterious artifact at a crime scene that reacts to the city's nightly transformation, linking the victim to a magical underground.",
    "Following the artifact's clues, Jules is hunted by a shadowy faction that controls the city's magical economy, forcing him into an uneasy alliance with the otherworldly entities of the night.",
    "Jules learns the city's transformation is a failing magical containment spell, and the conspiracy he's uncovered aims to shatter it, unleashing chaos for their own gain."
  ]
}
```

Now, generate the JSON for the `plot_points` field with `{{ list_count }}` items.
