## Task

Create a detailed outline for Act {{ act_number }}. Your outline should:

1. **Act Summary:** Brief overview (2-3 sentences) of what happens in this act
2. **Opening:** How does this act begin? What's the initial situation?
3. **Key Events:** What are the 5-7 most important events in this act?
4. **Character Development:** How do characters grow/change in this act?
5. **Conflict Progression:** How does tension build throughout the act?
6. **Act Resolution:** How does this act end? What's the cliffhanger/transition?
7. **Thematic Elements:** How is the theme explored in this act?
8. **Pacing Notes:** Which chapters should be fast-paced? Which should be slower?

Remember:
- This is Act {{ act_number }} ({{ act_role }}), so the content should match this role
- Events should naturally span approximately {{ chapters_in_act }} chapters
- Maintain consistency with the global outline
- Set up elements that will be important in later acts

Write a detailed act outline (400-600 words).
