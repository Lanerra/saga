## Task

Write a detailed act outline in prose (no JSON).

Output structure (use these section headers exactly):
1. Act Summary (2–3 sentences)
2. Opening Situation
3. Key Events (5–7 short paragraphs; each paragraph is an on-page event with cause→effect)
4. Character Development (focus on internal conflict + choices)
5. Stakes and Tension (how pressure escalates)
6. Act Ending / Turn (cliffhanger or decisive shift)
7. Thematic Thread (how theme appears through action/imagery)
8. Pacing Notes (fast vs slow chapters)

Constraints:
- Stay consistent with the global outline.
- Use named characters and concrete locations.
- No meta-commentary.
