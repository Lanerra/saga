## Task

You MUST output ONLY valid JSON that matches the enforced grammar for a character sheet.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be a single JSON object.
- Output MUST contain EXACTLY these top-level keys (no more, no less):
  - "name" (string, MUST be "{{ character_name }}")
  - "description" (string)
  - "traits" (array of single-word strings)
  - "status" (string, MUST be "Active")
  - "motivations" (string)
  - "background" (string)
  - "skills" (array of strings)
  - "relationships" (object mapping character name -> string)
  - "internal_conflict" (string)
- Do NOT include a top-level "type" field; runtime injects it.
- Do NOT include markdown, code fences, commentary, or any text outside the JSON.

Field guidance (encode inside the JSON fields above):
- description: vivid and specific; 180-260 words.
- traits: 5-7 traits; each must be ONE WORD (letters/numbers/hyphen only).
- motivations/background/internal_conflict: concrete, story-driving.
- skills: 3-6 concrete skills.
- relationships: include entries for relevant other main characters (if any).
