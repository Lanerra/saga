## Task

Return a single JSON object with EXACTLY these top-level keys (no more, no less):
- "name" (string; MUST be "{{ character_name }}")
- "description" (string)
- "traits" (array of single-word strings)
- "status" (string; MUST be "Active")
- "motivations" (string)
- "background" (string)
- "skills" (array of strings)
- "relationships" (object mapping character name -> {"type": string, "description": string})
- "internal_conflict" (string)

Do NOT include a top-level "type" field; runtime injects it.

Field guidance (encode inside the JSON fields above):
- description: vivid and specific; 60-90 words (<= 700 chars).
- traits: 5-7 traits; each must be ONE WORD (letters/numbers/hyphen only).
- motivations: 1-2 sentences (<= 240 chars).
- background: 1-2 sentences (<= 240 chars).
- internal_conflict: 1 sentence (<= 180 chars).
- skills: 3-5 concrete skills; each item <= 30 chars.
- relationships: include entries for relevant other main characters (if any).
  - type: MUST be one of: {{ relationship_types }}
  - description: <= 180 chars.

Hard constraints:
- Every string value MUST be a single line (no newline characters).
- Do not repeat or “narrate” the task inside any field.
- Keep the total JSON output compact.
