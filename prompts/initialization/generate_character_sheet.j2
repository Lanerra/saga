## Task

Create a detailed character sheet for {{ character_name }}. Ensure the character is multidimensional, with a distinct voice, clear backstory, and logical motivations suitable for a Pulitzer-level narrative.

## Required Structure

Output MUST be a single JSON object (no markdown) with ONLY the following top-level keys (no additional keys):

1. **name**: The character's name ("{{ character_name }}")
2. **description**: Comprehensive, evocative description (200-300 words) covering physical appearance, personality, and background. Avoid clichés; focus on unique details that reveal character.
3. **traits**: List of 5-7 **single-word** personality traits (e.g., "brave", "cynical", "impulsive"). Each trait must be ONE WORD ONLY.
4. **status**: "Active"
5. **motivations**: What drives this character? What do they want? (1-2 sentences). Ensure motivations are grounded in their background and drive the plot.
6. **background**: Brief history and important life events (1-2 sentences) that explain their current state.
7. **skills**: List of 3-5 key skills or abilities.
8. **relationships**: Dictionary mapping other character names to relationship descriptions (string values).
9. **internal_conflict**: What internal struggle will they face? (1 sentence)

Do NOT include a top-level **type** field; the runtime will inject and normalize `type: "Character"` after parsing.
