## Task

Return a single JSON object with EXACTLY these top-level keys (no more, no less):
- "name" (string; MUST be "{{ character_name }}")
- "description" (string)
- "traits" (array of single-word strings)
- "status" (string; MUST be "Active")
- "motivations" (string)
- "background" (string)
- "skills" (array of strings)
- "relationships" (object mapping character name -> string)
- "internal_conflict" (string)

Do NOT include a top-level "type" field; runtime injects it.

Field guidance (encode inside the JSON fields above):
- description: vivid and specific; 180-260 words.
- traits: 5-7 traits; each must be ONE WORD (letters/numbers/hyphen only).
- motivations/background/internal_conflict: concrete, story-driving.
- skills: 3-6 concrete skills.
- relationships: include entries for relevant other main characters (if any).
