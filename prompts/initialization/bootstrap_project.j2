You are generating configuration for an autonomous novel generation system.

The system will use your configuration to generate a complete multi-chapter novel. Your choices determine genre conventions, thematic focus, setting detail, and narrative coherence.

User Input: {{ user_input }}

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:

1. **Genre Specificity**: Be as specific as the input allows.
   - Vague input → broader genre (acceptable, gives LLM creative freedom)
   - Specific input → precise subgenre (improves coherence)

   Examples:
   - "romance" → "Contemporary Romance"
   - "romance in old South" → "Historical Romance - Antebellum American South"
   - "sci-fi about miners" → "Science Fiction - Asteroid Belt Labor Drama"

2. **Theme Concreteness**: State the central thematic question in 1-2 sentences.
   - Good: "Can love transcend rigid social hierarchies in plantation society?"
   - Bad: "Love and society" (too vague)

3. **Setting Detail**: Include 2-3 sentences with specific details.
   - Location names, technological context, social structures
   - Good: "Charleston, SC, 1855. Grand estates and debutante balls against the shadow of slavery."
   - Bad: "The old South" (system already knows this from user input)

4. **Narrative Style**: Always use "{{ default_narrative_style }}"
   - Other styles not yet supported by the system

Return ONLY a JSON object with these exact fields:
```json
{
  "title": "A compelling, specific title reflecting the premise",
  "genre": "Most specific subgenre you can infer",
  "theme": "Central thematic question (1-2 sentences, concrete)",
  "setting": "Detailed setting description (2-3 sentences with specifics)",
  "protagonist_name": "A fitting name for the main character",
  "narrative_style": "{{ default_narrative_style }}",
  "total_chapters": {{ total_chapters }}
}
```

EXAMPLE:

Input: "A romance novel set in the old South"

Output:
```json
{
  "title": "Magnolia Vows",
  "genre": "Historical Romance - Antebellum American South",
  "theme": "Can love transcend the rigid social hierarchies of plantation society, or will tradition and family expectation ultimately prevail?",
  "setting": "Charleston, South Carolina, 1855. A world of grand estates, debutante balls, and the looming shadow of slavery. The protagonist navigates a society where family reputation is everything and marriage is a strategic alliance rather than a matter of the heart.",
  "protagonist_name": "Annabelle Ashford",
  "narrative_style": "{{ default_narrative_style }}",
  "total_chapters": {{ total_chapters }}
}
```
