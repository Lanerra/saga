## Task

You MUST output ONLY valid JSON that matches the enforced grammar for a chapter outline.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be a single JSON object.
- Output MUST contain EXACTLY these three keys (no more, no less):
  - "scene_description" (string)
  - "key_beats" (array of strings)
  - "plot_point" (string)
- Do NOT include markdown, code fences, commentary, headings, or any text outside the JSON.

Content guidance (encode inside the JSON fields):
- scene_description: 2–4 sentences grounding where/when/who + immediate tension.
- key_beats: 3–5 beats, each a concrete on-page action with clear cause→effect.
- plot_point: 1–2 sentences for the chapter’s single most important change.

Return ONLY the JSON object.
