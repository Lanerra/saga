## Task

Return a single JSON object with EXACTLY these three keys (no more, no less):
- "scene_description" (string)
- "key_beats" (array of strings)
- "plot_point" (string)

Content guidance (encode inside the JSON fields):
- scene_description: 2-4 sentences grounding where/when/who + immediate tension.
- key_beats: 5-8 sequential beats, each representing a concrete on-page action with clear cause→effect. These beats must be ordered chronologically and will be directly mapped to individual scenes in the chapter.
- plot_point: 1-2 sentences for the chapter's single most important change.

CRITICAL OUTPUT CONTRACT:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (the entire response must be JSON; no surrounding text).
- Return a single JSON object at the top level.
- Do NOT wrap the object in an array or another object.
