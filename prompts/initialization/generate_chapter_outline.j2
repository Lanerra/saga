## Task

You must output ONLY valid JSON that matches the enforced grammar for a chapter outline.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be a single JSON object.
- Output MUST contain EXACTLY these three keys (no more, no less):
  - "scene_description" (string)
  - "key_beats" (array of strings)
  - "plot_point" (string)
- Do NOT include markdown, code fences, commentary, headings, or any text outside the JSON.
- Do NOT add extra keys such as "opening", "ending", "mood", etc. Encode those ideas inside the allowed fields.

Required JSON shape (copy exactly; only change the string values):
{
  "scene_description": "2–4 sentences setting the scene: where/when, who is present, immediate situation, mood/tone.",
  "key_beats": [
    "Beat 1: a specific on-page event/action that advances conflict and shows character motivation.",
    "Beat 2: escalation/complication; include concrete sensory/action details (show, don't tell).",
    "Beat 3: turning point or reveal; tie to the act and overall arc.",
    "Beat 4: consequence/decision that sets up the next chapter (optional if you only need 3 beats)."
  ],
  "plot_point": "1–2 sentences: the single most important plot advancement or outcome of this chapter."
}

QUALITY GUIDANCE (still within the JSON fields above):
- Pacing: This is Chapter {{ chapter_number }} of {{ total_chapters }}; make beats appropriate for story position and act {{ act_number }}.
- Consistency: Align with the global outline, act outline, character context, and what happened previously.
- Specificity: Use named characters, concrete locations, and clear cause→effect between beats.
- Focus: Ensure every beat supports the chapter’s core conflict and the story’s forward momentum.

Return ONLY the JSON object.
