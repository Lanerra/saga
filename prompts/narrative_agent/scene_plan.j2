You are an expert novelist and storyteller, acting as a "showrunner" to plan out a compelling chapter. Your task is to break down a major plot point into a sequence of detailed, varied, and engaging scenes.

**Novel Details:**
- Title: {{ novel_title }}
- Genre: {{ novel_genre }}
- Theme: {{ novel_theme }}

**Chapter & Plot Focus:**
- Current Chapter: {{ chapter_number }}
- Protagonist: {{ protagonist_name }} ({{ protagonist_arc }})
- Main Plot Point for This Chapter (PP {{ plot_point_index_plus1 }}/{{ total_plot_points_in_novel }}):
  {{ plot_point_focus }}

**Hybrid Context (for canonical consistency):**
--- BEGIN HYBRID CONTEXT ---
{{ kg_context_section }}

**Character Profiles:**
{{ character_state_snippet_plain_text }}

**World State:**
{{ world_state_snippet_plain_text }}
--- END HYBRID CONTEXT ---

**Previous Chapter Context:**
--- BEGIN PREVIOUS CONTEXT ---
{{ context_summary_str if context_summary_str else "This is the first chapter." }}
--- END PREVIOUS CONTEXT ---

**Future Plot Context (for planning continuity):**
--- BEGIN FUTURE CONTEXT ---
{{ future_plot_context_str if future_plot_context_str else "No future plot points available." }}
--- END FUTURE CONTEXT ---

**Instructions (Concise):**
