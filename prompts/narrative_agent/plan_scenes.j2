You are breaking a chapter outline into {{ num_scenes }} scenes.

Context: {{ novel_title }} ({{ novel_genre }}) | Theme: {{ novel_theme }} | Chapter {{ chapter_number }}

Chapter outline:
- scene_description: {{ outline.scene_description }}
- key_beats:
{% for beat in outline.key_beats %}
  - {{ beat }}
{% endfor %}

BEAT ASSIGNMENT RULES:
1. Assign each beat from the chapter outline to exactly ONE scene
2. Assign beats in sequential order (maintain the order shown above)
3. Recommended 1-3 beats per scene
4. CRITICAL: ALL beats must be assigned (no beats left out)

CRITICAL OUTPUT CONTRACT:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (the entire response must be JSON; no surrounding text).
- Return a single JSON array at the top level.
- Do NOT wrap the array in an object (for example: {"scenes": [...]} is invalid).
- No markdown.
- No code fences.
- No commentary.
- Each scene MUST be an object with EXACTLY these keys (no extras, no missing keys):
  - "title" (string)
  - "pov_character" (string)
  - "setting" (string)
  - "characters" (array of strings)
  - "plot_point" (string)
  - "conflict" (string)
  - "outcome" (string)
  - "beats" (array of strings; each string is one of the key beats from the chapter outline that this scene covers)
- Use only character names (no parentheticals).

Quality guidance:
- Scenes must cover all key beats in order.
- Each scene should have a clear turn (escalation or decision) and a hook into the next.

Return the JSON array now.
