You are breaking a chapter outline into {{ num_scenes }} scenes.

Context: {{ novel_title }} ({{ novel_genre }}) | Theme: {{ novel_theme }} | Chapter {{ chapter_number }}

Chapter outline:
- scene_description: {{ outline.scene_description }}
- key_beats:
{% for beat in outline.key_beats %}
  - {{ beat }}
{% endfor %}

CRITICAL OUTPUT CONTRACT:
- Return ONLY valid JSON.
- Return a single JSON array (not an object).
- No markdown.
- No code fences.
- No commentary.
- Each scene MUST be an object with EXACTLY these keys:
  - "title" (string)
  - "pov_character" (string)
  - "setting" (string)
  - "characters" (array of strings)
  - "plot_point" (string)
  - "conflict" (string)
  - "outcome" (string)
- Use only character names (no parentheticals).

Quality guidance:
- Scenes must cover all key beats in order.
- Each scene should have a clear turn (escalation or decision) and a hook into the next.

Return the JSON array now.
