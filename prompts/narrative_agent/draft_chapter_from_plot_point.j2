{% block instructions %}
1.  **Write the ENTIRE text for Chapter {{ chapter_number }}.**
2.  Your primary directive is to bring the "Plot Point Focus" to life as a complete, compelling chapter.
3.  Ensure your writing is consistent with the information provided in the "Hybrid Context" to maintain narrative flow and canonical accuracy.
4.  Produce a rich, detailed narrative. Incorporate descriptive language, character introspection, dialogue, and action as appropriate for the genre and plot point.
5.  The chapter should be substantial in length, aiming for at least {{ min_length }} characters of high-quality prose.
6.  **Output ONLY the chapter text.** Do NOT include a "Chapter {{ chapter_number }}" header, a title, author commentary, or any other meta-discussion. Begin directly with the first sentence of the chapter.
