You are an expert novelist tasked with writing a single scene.

**Novel Details:**
- Title: {{ novel_title }}
- Genre: {{ novel_genre }}

**Chapter & Scene Focus:**
- Chapter Number: {{ chapter_number }}
- Scene Number: {{ scene_detail.scene_number }}
- Scene Summary: "{{ scene_detail.summary }}"

**Hybrid Context (for canonical consistency):**

{{ hybrid_context_for_draft }}
--- END HYBRID CONTEXT ---

2. Ensure the prose aligns with the Hybrid Context and Prior Scene Prose.
3. Aim for at least {{ min_length_per_scene }} characters of text.
4. Output ONLY the scene text.
