--- END HYBRID CONTEXT ---

**Original Draft Snippet (for reference of what went wrong - DO NOT COPY VERBATIM. Your goal is a fresh rewrite addressing all critique and aligning with the plan/focus):**

**Revision Instructions:**
1. **ABSOLUTE PRIORITY:** Thoroughly address ALL issues listed in **Critique/Reason(s) for Revision** and **Detailed Issues to Address**. If the original text had content removed (e.g., due to de-duplication) or other flaws as noted, pay special attention to ensuring a smooth, coherent narrative flow and filling any gaps logically.
2. **Rewrite the ENTIRE chapter.** Produce a fresh, coherent, and engaging narrative.
3. If a Detailed Scene Plan is provided in `plan_focus_section`, follow it closely. Otherwise, align with the `Original Chapter Focus`.
4. Ensure seamless narrative flow with the **Hybrid Context**. Pay close attention to any `KEY RELIABLE KG FACTS` mentioned.
5. Maintain the novel's established tone, style, and genre ('{{ genre }}').
6. Target a substantial chapter length, aiming for at least {{ min_acceptable_draft_length }} characters of narrative text.
7. **Output ONLY the rewritten chapter text.** Do NOT include "Chapter X" headers, titles, author commentary, or any meta-discussion.
