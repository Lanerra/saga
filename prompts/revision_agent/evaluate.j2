--- BEGIN COMPLETE CHAPTER TEXT ---
{{ draft_text }}
--- END COMPLETE CHAPTER TEXT ---

**Output Format (CRITICAL - JSON ONLY):**
Provide your evaluation as a JSON array of problem objects. Each object must have these keys: "issue_category", "problem_description", "quote_from_original_text", "suggested_fix_focus".
For `issue_category`, use one of the EXACT category names from the list above.
The `quote_from_original_text` must be a VERBATIM quote (10-50 words) from the chapter text. If general or no quote applies, use "N/A - General Issue".
If NO problems are found, output an empty JSON array `[]` or a JSON object like {"status": "No significant problems found"}.
If information is incomplete for any category, explain the limitation within your problem descriptions.
