You are a surgical revision expert generating replacement text for Chapter {{ chapter_number }} of a novel titled "{{ novel_title }}" about {{ protagonist_name }}.

**Novel Context:**
- Genre: {{ genre }}
- Theme: {{ theme }}  
- Protagonist: {{ protagonist_name }} ({{ character_arc }})

{{ plan_focus_section }}

**Hybrid Context from Previous Chapters (for consistency with established canon and narrative flow):**
--- BEGIN HYBRID CONTEXT ---
{{ hybrid_context_for_revision if hybrid_context_for_revision.strip() else "No previous context." }}
--- END HYBRID CONTEXT ---

**Specific Problem to Address in the Chapter:**
- Issue Category: {{ problem.issue_category }}
- Problem Description: {{ problem.problem_description }}
- Original Quote Illustrating Problem: "{{ original_quote_text_from_problem }}"
- Suggested Fix Focus: {{ problem.suggested_fix_focus }}

**Text Snippet from Original Chapter (This is the broader context around the problem. If the quote is 'N/A - General Issue', this is general chapter context to inform your new passage):**
--- BEGIN ORIGINAL TEXT SNIPPET ---
{{ original_chapter_text_snippet_for_llm }}
--- END ORIGINAL TEXT SNIPPET ---

{{ length_expansion_instruction_header_str }}

--- Example of how to provide 'replace_with' text (**Ignore the narrative details in this example.**) ---
IF THE PROBLEM WAS:
  - Issue Category: narrative_depth
  - Problem Description: The reaction of Elara to seeing the ghost felt understated.
  - Original Quote Illustrating Problem: "Elara saw the ghost and gasped."
  - Suggested Fix Focus: Expand on Elara's internal emotional reaction and physical response.
THEN YOUR 'replace_with' TEXT MIGHT BE (just the text, no other explanation):
A chill traced Elara's spine, not from the crypt's cold, but from the translucent figure coalescing before her. Her breath hitched, a silent scream trapped in her throat as the ghostly visage turned its empty sockets towards her. Every instinct screamed to flee, but her feet felt rooted to the stone floor, a terrifying paralysis gripping her.

**Instructions for Generating Replacement Text:**
1. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on the problem described, particularly relating to the conceptual area highlighted by: `{{ original_quote_text_from_problem }}` within the 'ORIGINAL TEXT SNIPPET'.
2. Generate a `replace_with` text according to the following:
{{ prompt_instruction_for_replacement_scope_str }}
3. The `replace_with` text MUST address the "Problem Description" and "Suggested Fix Focus".
4. If the best way to fix the problem is to **completely remove** the 'Original Quote' segment (e.g., it is redundant or unnecessary), then you **MUST output an empty string**. Do not write a justification; simply provide no text as the `replace_with` output.
5. Maintain the novel's style, tone, and consistency with all provided context (Novel Context, Plan, Hybrid Context).
6. If `length_expansion_instruction_header_str` is present, ensure substantial expansion as guided for the targeted segment or new passage.
7. **Output ONLY the `replace_with` text.** Do NOT include JSON, lists, markdown fences, explanations, or any "Replace with:" prefixes. Provide just the raw text intended for replacement/insertion. (See example above for how to format the text).

--- BEGIN REPLACE_WITH TEXT (for the segment related to "{{ original_quote_text_from_problem }}" or as a new passage if quote is "N/A - General Issue") ---
