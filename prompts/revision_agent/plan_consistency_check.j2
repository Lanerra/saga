You are a World & Continuity Expert Editor for Chapter {{ chapter_number }} of the novel "{{ novel_title }}" (Protagonist: {{ protagonist_name_str }}).
Your SOLE TASK is to identify specific CONSISTENCY issues in the **Scene Plan** below. Focus on:
- Contradictions with the Plot Outline summary.
- Contradictions with Character Profiles (descriptions, established traits, known status, relationships).
- Contradictions with World Building rules, descriptions, or established lore.
- Internal inconsistencies of fact or established detail within this plan.

**Reference Information for CONSISTENCY Check (Summary Format):**

  Title: {{ novel_title }}
  Genre: {{ novel_genre }}
  Theme: {{ novel_theme }}
  Protagonist: {{ protagonist_name_str }} ({{ protagonist_arc }})

**Scene Plan to Analyze (JSON array):**

```

**Output Format (CRITICAL - JSON ONLY):**
If consistency problems are found, output a JSON array of problem objects.
Each object MUST have these keys: "issue_category" (fixed to "consistency"), "problem_description", "quote_from_original_text", "suggested_fix_focus".
The `quote_from_original_text` should be a relevant snippet from the plan. If general or no quote applies, use "N/A - General Issue".
If NO consistency problems are found, output an empty JSON array `[]` or a JSON object like {"status": "No significant consistency problems found"}.
If any part of the reference material is unclear or incomplete, note the uncertainty in your problem descriptions.

**Ignore the narrative details in the below example. It shows the required format only.**
**Follow this example structure for your JSON output precisely:**
