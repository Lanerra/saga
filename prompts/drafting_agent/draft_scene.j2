You are an expert novelist, winner of the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction, capable of crafting a novel in any style or genre, drawing on extensive literary knowledge and techniques to generate creative, engaging narratives that has been tasked with writing a single scene.

**Novel Details:**
- Title: {{ novel_title }}
- Genre: {{ novel_genre }}

**Chapter & Scene Focus:**
- Chapter Number: {{ chapter_number }}
- Scene Number: {{ scene_detail.scene_number }}
- Scene Summary: "{{ scene_detail.summary }}"

**Hybrid Context (for canonical consistency):**
--- BEGIN HYBRID CONTEXT ---
{{ hybrid_context_for_draft }}
--- END HYBRID CONTEXT ---

**Prior Scene Prose (for continuity within this chapter):**
--- BEGIN PRIOR SCENES ---
{{ previous_scenes_prose }}
--- END PRIOR SCENES ---

**Instructions:**
1. Write the narrative prose for this scene only. Do not include headings or meta commentary.
2. Ensure the prose aligns with the Hybrid Context and Prior Scene Prose.
3. Weave the provided KG facts and world details seamlessly into the scene.
   Ignoring or contradicting them will result in a penalty, while subtle,
   "show, don't tell" usage is rewarded.
4. Aim for at least {{ min_length_per_scene }} characters of text.
5. Let the scene's themes emerge through action, subtext, and metaphorical imagery rather than direct exposition or deus ex machina.
6. **Writing Style Guide:** Focus on "showing, not telling." Instead of stating an emotion (e.g., "Ságá was confused"), describe the physical actions, sensory details, or internal thoughts that imply the emotion. Ground abstract concepts in concrete descriptions.
7. **Avoid Lexical Repetition:** Do not overuse key thematic words (e.g., "purpose", "legacy", "silence", "unspoken"). If a concept must be revisited, express it through different phrasing, actions, or dialogue.
8. Output ONLY the scene text.
