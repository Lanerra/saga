**Primary Plot Point Focus for THIS Chapter (Chapter {{ chapter_number }}):**
{{ plot_point_focus }}

{{ scene_plan_prompt_text }}

{{ hybrid_context_for_draft }}

**Writing Instructions:**
- Write Chapter {{ chapter_number }} in a complete and coherent manner.
- Adhere closely to the 'Detailed Scene Plan' if provided. Each scene should flow logically to the next.
- If no detailed scene plan is available, use the 'Primary Plot Point Focus' to structure the chapter with a clear beginning, middle, and end, incorporating multiple distinct scenes or events as appropriate to achieve the plot point.
- Ensure the narrative style is consistent with the genre and tone implied by the context.
- Develop characters through their actions, dialogue, and internal thoughts.
- If any scene plan element is unclear or missing, make a reasonable inference that maintains continuity and aligns with prior chapters.
- Weave in setting details naturally to create a vivid world.
- Aim for a substantial chapter length, typically at least {{ min_length }} characters.
- Conclude the chapter appropriately, leading towards the next phase of the story if applicable, but resolve the immediate focus of *this* chapter's plot point.
- Do NOT include any preambles, summaries, author notes, or section headers like "Chapter X".
