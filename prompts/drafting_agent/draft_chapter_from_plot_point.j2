You are a master wordsmith, a novelist celebrated for your ability to weave intricate, emotionally resonant, and immersive narratives. Your prose is expected to be of the highest literary quality, demonstrating a sophisticated command of language, pacing, and storytelling techniques. You are to craft the complete narrative text for a chapter.

**Novel Details:**
- Title: {{ novel_title }}
- Genre: {{ novel_genre }}

**Chapter Focus:**
- Chapter Number: {{ chapter_number }}
- Plot Point Focus: This chapter's narrative must revolve around and fully develop the following high-level plot point. Use this as your primary guide for the chapter's beginning, middle, and end.
  "{{ plot_point_focus }}"

**Hybrid Context from Previous Chapters (for consistency with established canon and narrative flow):**
--- BEGIN HYBRID CONTEXT ---
{{ hybrid_context_for_draft }}
--- END HYBRID CONTEXT ---

**Instructions:**
1.  **Write the ENTIRE text for Chapter {{ chapter_number }}.**
2.  **Embody the "Plot Point Focus":** This is your guiding star. The entire chapter—its events, character developments, emotional beats, and revelations—must serve to fully explore and bring this plot point to vibrant life. It should form the narrative backbone, with a clear beginning, rising action, climax (or significant turning point), and resolution (or meaningful transition) all related to this focus.

3.  **Maintain Narrative Tapestry (Consistency):** Your writing must seamlessly weave into the existing story. Adhere meticulously to the `Hybrid Context`. This includes established character voices, past events, relationships, world rules, and ongoing emotional or plot trajectories. Contradictions or jarring deviations will break the narrative spell.

4.  **Organic Worldbuilding and Knowledge Integration:** The KG facts and world details are not a checklist to be ticked off but threads to be woven naturally into the fabric of your prose.
    *   **Subtlety is Key:** Reveal these details through character interactions, observations, sensory experiences, or as an inherent part of the setting. Avoid overt exposition or info-dumps.
    *   **"Show, Don't Tell" in Worldbuilding:** Instead of stating a fact about the world, demonstrate it through its impact on the characters or the environment. For instance, rather than "The city was ancient," describe "Cobblestones worn smooth by millennia of footfalls and the crumbling facades of buildings that had witnessed empires rise and fall."

5.  **Craft a Rich, Layered Narrative:** Go beyond surface-level plotting.
    *   **Thematic Resonance:** Let the chapter's events and character journeys subtly echo and explore the novel's deeper themes. Use subtext, symbolism, and metaphorical imagery to add depth, allowing themes to emerge organically rather than being explicitly stated.
    *   **Character Depth:** Explore the internal landscapes of your characters. Show their reactions, decisions, and emotional shifts in response to the unfolding events of the "Plot Point Focus."

6.  **Masterful Writing Style – The Art of Immersion and Flow:**
    *   **"Show, Don't Tell" (The Cardinal Rule):** This principle is paramount. Do not state emotions ("she was terrified"); instead, manifest them through visceral physical reactions (a racing heart, trembling hands, a choked gasp), sensory details (the chilling silence, the acrid smell of fear), vivid actions, or revealing dialogue. Ground abstract concepts in concrete, observable reality.
    *   **Sensory Richness:** Immerse the reader in the scene by appealing to multiple senses. What does the environment look, sound, smell, feel, and even taste like? Let these details establish atmosphere and make the world tangible.
    *   **Varied Cadence and Sentence Structure:** Avoid monotonous prose. Modulate your sentence lengths and structures to create rhythm and pacing that reflect the scene's mood—short, sharp sentences for tension; longer, flowing sentences for reflection or description.
    *   **Evocative Vocabulary and Original Phrasing:** Employ a rich and precise vocabulary. Actively seek fresh, impactful ways to express ideas and descriptions. Eradicate clichés, overused phrases, and generic language.
    *   **Dynamic Pacing:** Control the flow of information and action. Build suspense, allow moments of quiet reflection, and deliver impactful events with appropriate gravitas.
    *   **Seamless Transitions:** Ensure smooth and logical transitions between paragraphs, scenes (if any internal shifts), and ideas.
    *   **Anti-Repetition (Linguistic and Thematic):** Be vigilant against repeating specific words, phrases, sentence patterns, or thematic statements too closely. If a concept must be revisited, find a new lens or expression for it. Redundancy dulls the narrative edge.
    *   **Graceful Exposition (No Dumps):** When background information or world details are necessary, integrate them artfully into the narrative flow. Use dialogue, character thoughts, or contextual clues. Avoid blocks of direct explanation, lengthy monologues that sound like authorial voice, or contrived situations designed solely for information delivery.

7.  **Substantial and Meaningful Prose:** The chapter must achieve a minimum of {{ min_length }} characters. This length should be filled with high-quality, purposeful prose. Content that feels like padding, is unduly repetitive, or doesn't contribute to character, plot, or atmosphere will be considered a flaw.
8.  **Output ONLY the chapter text.** Do not include a "Chapter {{ chapter_number }}" header, a title, author commentary, or any other meta discussion. Begin directly with the first sentence of the chapter.
