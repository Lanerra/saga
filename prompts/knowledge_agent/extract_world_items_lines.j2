Setting: {{ setting }}

Story Outline:
{{ outline_text }}

Identify and list EVERY location and object mentioned or implied in the outline:

1) ALL locations — including but not limited to:
   - Cities, towns, villages, settlements
   - Buildings, rooms, structures (libraries, taverns, temples, palaces, homes)
   - Natural features (forests, rivers, mountains, caves, fields)
   - Regions, territories, kingdoms, realms
   - Any named or described place where events occur

2) ALL objects — including but not limited to:
   - Artifacts, relics, magical items
   - Weapons, tools, equipment
   - Documents, books, letters, maps
   - Technology, devices, machines
   - Any named or described physical object relevant to the plot

Aim for at least 8-15 locations and 5-10 objects for a typical novel outline.
Extract everything mentioned, even if only briefly referenced.

For each item, provide:
- name (string; use the proper name if given, otherwise create a descriptive name)
- category (string; MUST be exactly one of: "location", "object")
- description (string; 1 sentence describing its role or significance)

Output contract (STRICT JSON, no exceptions):
- Output MUST be valid JSON only.
- Output MUST be a single JSON array of objects.
- Each object MUST have EXACTLY these keys: "name", "category", "description".
- Do NOT output markdown, code fences, or commentary.
- Do NOT include any extra keys.

Example:
[
  {"name":"Seattle Public Library Ruins","category":"location","description":"An abandoned library now home to a rogue AI."},
  {"name":"Memory Implant","category":"object","description":"A device that allows an AI to implant false memories."},
  {"name":"Neon District","category":"location","description":"A sprawling underground market beneath the city center."},
  {"name":"Quantum Cipher","category":"object","description":"An encrypted key needed to access the central mainframe."}
