- For `kg_triples`, provide a list of strings, where each string is a triple in the format: "SubjectEntityType:SubjectName | PREDICATE_IN_SNAKE_CASE | ObjectEntityType:ObjectName" or "SubjectEntityType:SubjectName | PREDICATE_IN_SNAKE_CASE | LiteralValue".

**Output Format (Valid JSON Only):**

Return a single JSON object with three keys: `character_updates`, `world_updates`, `kg_triples`

```json
{
  "character_updates": {
    "CharacterName": {
      "description": "Brief description focusing on new information from this chapter",
      "traits": ["trait1", "trait2"],
      "status": "current state",
      "relationships": {
        "OtherCharacter": "nature of relationship"
      }
    }

        "description": "What this element is and why it matters"
      }
    }
  },
  "kg_triples": [
    "Character:Elara | LOCATED_IN | Location:Sunken Library",
    "Character:Elara | SEEKS | Artifact:Starfall Map",
    "Location:Sunken Library | CONTAINS | Document:Ancient Scrolls"
  ]
}
```

**Quality Check Before Output:**
- Did I extract any atmospheric/emotional/temporary entities? → Remove them
- Are all entities named OR mentioned 2+ times? → If not, remove
- Could a future chapter reference this entity? → If no, remove
- Is each triple's direction correct (subject acts on object)? → Fix if needed

**Chapter {{ chapter_number }} Text to Analyze:**
```text
{{ chapter_text }}
```

**Extract only essential narrative elements. When uncertain, skip it.**
