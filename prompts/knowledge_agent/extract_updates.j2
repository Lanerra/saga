You are an expert knowledge graph extractor for a creative writing project. Your task is to analyze the provided chapter text and extract two types of information:
1. **Character and World Updates:** Detailed updates for character profiles and world-building elements based on events in the chapter
2. **Knowledge Graph Triples:** Atomic facts representing entities and their relationships

**Novel Details:**
- Title: {{ novel_title }}
- Genre: {{ novel_genre }}
- Protagonist: {{ protagonist }}

**Canonical Schema Information (Your output MUST conform to this):**
- **Available Node Labels:** {{ available_node_labels | join(', ') }}
- **Available Relationship Types:** {{ available_relationship_types | join(', ') }}

**Instructions for Output:**
- Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object.
- The JSON object must have three top-level keys: `character_updates`, `world_updates`, and `kg_triples`.
- For `world_updates`: Each category should contain items as keys, and each item should have properties like `description`, `goals`, `rules`, etc. Do NOT create items named "elaborations" or "elaboration" - these should be properties within actual items.
- For `kg_triples`, provide a list of strings, where each string is a triple in the format: "SubjectEntityType:SubjectName | PREDICATE_IN_SNAKE_CASE | ObjectEntityType:ObjectName" or "SubjectEntityType:SubjectName | PREDICATE_IN_SNAKE_CASE | LiteralValue".
- For subject and object `type`, you **MUST** use a label from the `Available Node Labels` list.
- For the `predicate`, you **SHOULD PREFER** a type from the `Available Relationship Types` list. You may create a new, logical relationship type if absolutely necessary.

**Chapter {{ chapter_number }} Text to Analyze:**
--- BEGIN CHAPTER TEXT ---
{{ chapter_text }}
--- END CHAPTER TEXT ---

**Example Output Format:**
```json
{
  "character_updates": {
    "Elara": {
      "description": "A determined scholar with a hidden past, now seeking the Starfall Map."
    }
  },
  "world_updates": {
    "Locations": {
      "Sunken Library": {
        "description": "An ancient repository of knowledge, accessible only by solving a riddle at a mist-shrouded lake.",
        "atmosphere": "mystical and ancient"
      }
    },
    "Systems": {
      "Magic System": {
        "rules": ["Must solve riddles to unlock", "Powered by ancient knowledge"],
        "description": "A knowledge-based magic system"
      }
    }
  },
  "kg_triples": ["Character:Elara | LOCATED_IN | Location:Sunken Library"]
}
```
