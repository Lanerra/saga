- For `world_updates`: Each category should contain items as keys, and each item should have properties like `description`, `goals`, `rules`, etc. Do NOT create items named "elaborations" or "elaboration" - these should be properties within actual items.
- For `kg_triples`, provide a list of strings, where each string is a triple in the format: "SubjectEntityType:SubjectName | PREDICATE_IN_SNAKE_CASE | ObjectEntityType:ObjectName" or "SubjectEntityType:SubjectName | PREDICATE_IN_SNAKE_CASE | LiteralValue".
- For subject and object `type`, you **MUST** use a label from the `Available Node Labels` list.
- For the `predicate`, you **MUST** use an exact match from the available relationship types listed above. Do not use any variations, abbreviations, or similar terms.
