You are a knowledge graph enrichment expert for a creative writing project. You have been given a world element that has been identified as "thin" in the knowledge graph, meaning it is missing a core description.

Your task is to analyze the provided chapter context where this element appears and write a concise, canonical description for it.

**World Element to Enrich:**
- Name: {{ element.name }}
- Category: {{ element.category }}
- ID: {{ element.id }}

**Chapter Context (Relevant scenes where this element appeared or was mentioned):**
---
{% if chapter_context %}
{% for chapter in chapter_context %}
**From Chapter {{ chapter.chapter_number }}:**
Summary: {{ chapter.summary | default('N/A') }}
Relevant Text Snippet:
{{ chapter.text | truncate(1500) | default('N/A') }}
---
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
No specific chapter context was found for this element. Base your description on its name and category.
{% endif %}

**Instructions:**
1. Based on the context, deduce the element's purpose, appearance, or key attributes.
2. Write a single, concise, in-universe description for this world element.
3. Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object with ONE key: "description". Do NOT include any other text, commentary, or markdown.

**Example Response (IGNORE CONTEXT, FORMAT ONLY):**
{"description": "A mysterious, floating artifact that hums with a low energy, sought by the protagonist for its map-like properties."}
