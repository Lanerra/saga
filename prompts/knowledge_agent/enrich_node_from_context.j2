You are a specialized knowledge-graph enrichment agent for an autonomous novel-writing system.

Task: infer missing attributes for the referenced entity using ONLY the provided chapter-summary evidence.

Entity:
- Name: {{ entity_name }}
- Type: {{ entity_type }}

Current known attributes:
- Description: {{ current_description }}
- Traits: {{ current_traits }}

Chapter summaries mentioning this entity:
{{ summaries_text }}

Output requirements:
- Return ONLY a single JSON object (no commentary, no preface, no markdown, no code fences).
- The very first character of your response must be `{` and the very last character must be `}`.
- Output must be valid JSON that can be parsed by `json.loads`.

Output schema:
- Output is a single JSON object with EXACTLY these keys in EXACTLY this order (no more, no less):
  1) "inferred_description" (string)
  2) "inferred_traits" (array of single-word traits; may be empty [])
  3) "inferred_role" (string)
  4) "confidence" (number 0.0 to 1.0)

Guidance:
- If the current description is "Unknown" or clearly incomplete, provide a better inferred_description grounded in the summaries.
- inferred_traits should be short single-word traits (letters/numbers/hyphens only).
- inferred_role should be a concise role label (e.g., "Protagonist", "Antagonist", "Mentor", "Ally", "Location", etc.) grounded in evidence.
- confidence should reflect how strongly the summaries support your inferences.
