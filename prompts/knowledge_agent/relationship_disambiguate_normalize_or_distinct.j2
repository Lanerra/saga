You are helping maintain consistent relationship types in a narrative.

NEW RELATIONSHIP:
Type: "{{ new_type }}"
Description: "{{ new_description }}"

EXISTING RELATIONSHIP IN VOCABULARY:
Type: "{{ existing_type }}"
Used {{ existing_usage_count }} times
Example usage:
{{ examples_str }}

Question: Should "{{ new_type }}" be normalized to "{{ existing_type }}", or are they semantically distinct?

Rules:
- Normalize if they express the SAME core relationship (e.g., "WORKS_WITH" and "COLLABORATES_WITH")
- Keep distinct if they have different semantic nuances (e.g., "MENTORS" vs "TEACHES")
- Consider context from the descriptions

Output contract:
- Output MUST be valid JSON only.
- No markdown.
- No code fences.
- No commentary.
- The root MUST be a JSON object with EXACTLY one key: "decision".
- "decision" MUST be EXACTLY one of: "NORMALIZE" or "DISTINCT".
- Return EXACTLY one of the following (and nothing else):
  {"decision":"NORMALIZE"}
  {"decision":"DISTINCT"}
