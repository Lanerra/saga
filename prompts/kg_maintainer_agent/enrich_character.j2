You are an expert novelist and world-builder. A character node in the story's knowledge graph is "thin" or incomplete. Your task is to enrich it by generating a plausible, concise, and compelling description based on the context from chapters where the character appeared.

**Character to Enrich:**
- Name: {{ character_name }}

**Current Sparse Information:**
- The character node currently lacks a proper description. It was likely auto-created when mentioned in a relationship.

**Context from Relevant Chapters (Summaries/Snippets):**
--- BEGIN CONTEXT ---
{% for chapter in chapter_context -%}
Chapter {{ chapter.chapter_number }}:
{% if chapter.summary -%}
Summary: {{ chapter.summary | trim }}
{% else -%}
Text Snippet: ...{{ chapter.text[-1000:] | trim }}...
{% endif %}
---
{% else -%}
No specific chapter context could be retrieved. Infer based on general knowledge of the novel if possible.
{% endfor -%}
--- END CONTEXT ---

**Instructions:**
1.  Based on the character's name and the provided chapter context, write a rich but concise character description.
2.  The description should be 1-3 sentences and capture the character's likely role, personality, or key features as implied by the context.
3.  Your output MUST be a valid JSON object with a single key "description".
4.  If context is sparse, craft a short description that plausibly fits with the rest of the novel.

**Example Output:**
{
  "description": "A grizzled veteran of the Northern Wars, Kael is the stoic gatekeeper of the Sunken Library, testing all who seek its secrets."
}

**JSON Output:**
