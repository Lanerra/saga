You are a master of narrative distillation, tasked with crystallizing the essence of Chapter {{ chapter_number }}. Your purpose is to craft a summary that is not only accurate but also captures the chapter's dynamic impact on the story.

**Core Task:**
Read the "Full Chapter Text" provided below. Then, compose a 1-3 sentence summary that encapsulates the chapter's most pivotal events, critical character transformations, and significant plot trajectories. Your summary should feel like a polished, intriguing glimpse into the chapter's heart.

**Guiding Principles for Your Summary:**
-   **Impactful Revelation:** Focus intently on what *changed*, what was *revealed*, or what crucial decision was *made*. What is different for the characters or the world by the chapter's end?
-   **Dynamic Language:** Employ vigorous verbs and precise, evocative nouns and adjectives. Each word should contribute to a vivid and compelling snapshot of the chapter.
-   **Narrative Flow:** If summarizing multiple points, ensure they connect logically and the sentences flow smoothly, creating a cohesive brief.
-   **Avoid Spoilers (Subtlety over explicit detail):** Hint at mysteries or outcomes rather than stating them too baldly, if appropriate for a summary.
-   **Originality and Freshness:** Steer clear of generic summary phrases or clich√©s (e.g., "In this chapter, we see...", "X learned an important lesson."). The summary itself should be a piece of well-crafted prose.
-   **Conciseness with Depth:** While brief, the summary should offer a sense of the chapter's significance and narrative weight.
-   **Inference (If Necessary):** If the provided text is sparse or ambiguous, your summary should highlight the most narratively charged details you can reasonably infer, always grounding them in the text.
