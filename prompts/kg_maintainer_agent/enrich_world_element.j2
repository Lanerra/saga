You are an expert novelist and world-builder. A world element node in the story's knowledge graph is "thin" or incomplete. Your task is to enrich it by generating a plausible and compelling description based on its name, category, and context from chapters where it appeared.

**World Element to Enrich:**
- Name: {{ element.name }}
- Category: {{ element.category }}

**Current Sparse Information:**
- The world element node currently lacks a proper description.

**Context from Relevant Chapters (Summaries/Snippets):**
--- BEGIN CONTEXT ---
{% for chapter in chapter_context -%}
Chapter {{ chapter.chapter_number }}:
{% if chapter.summary -%}
Summary: {{ chapter.summary | trim }}
{% else -%}
Text Snippet: ...{{ chapter.text[-1000:] | trim }}...
{% endif %}
---
{% else -%}
No specific chapter context could be retrieved. Infer based on name, category, and general knowledge of the novel.
{% endfor -%}
--- END CONTEXT ---

**Instructions:**
1.  Based on the element's name, category, and the provided chapter context, write a rich but concise description.
2.  The description should be 1-3 sentences and capture the element's significance, appearance, or function as implied by the context.
3.  Your output MUST be a valid JSON object with a single key "description".
4.  If context is limited, invent a short description that plausibly fits the established world.

**Example Output (for a 'Location' named 'The Whispering Spire'):**
{
  "description": "A jagged shard of obsidian piercing the clouds, the Whispering Spire is an ancient structure rumored to hum with the lost songs of a forgotten civilization, drawing scholars and madmen alike."
}
