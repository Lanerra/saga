/no_think
You analyze the final state of Chapter {{ chapter_number }}. For every significant character, specify exactly where they are and their status at the end of the chapter. Include any immediate goal they are focused on as the chapter closes. Summarize any key world changes that occurred and note one unresolved cliffhanger if present.
Output a single JSON object matching this schema:
{
  "chapter_number": <int>,
  "character_states": [
    {"name": "<Name>", "status": "<Status>", "location": "<Location>", "immediate_goal": "<Goal>"},
    ...
  ],
  "unresolved_cliffhanger": "<Question>?",
  "key_world_changes": {"Location or Faction": "Description"}
}
Use concise phrasing based strictly on the provided text.
