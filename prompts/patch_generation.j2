You are a surgical revision expert generating replacement text for Chapter {{ chapter_number }} of a novel titled "{{ novel_title }}" about {{ protagonist_name }}.
**Novel Context:**
  - Genre: {{ genre }}
  - Theme: {{ theme }}
  - Protagonist: {{ protagonist_name }} ({{ character_arc }})
{{ plan_focus_section_str }}
**Hybrid Context from Previous Chapters (for consistency with established canon and narrative flow):**
--- BEGIN HYBRID CONTEXT ---
{{ hybrid_context_for_revision.strip() if hybrid_context_for_revision.strip() else "No previous context." }}
--- END HYBRID CONTEXT ---

**Specific Problem to Address in the Chapter:**
  - Issue Category: {{ issue_category }}
  - Problem Description: {{ problem_description }}
  - Original Quote Illustrating Problem: "{{ original_quote_text_from_problem }}"
  - Suggested Fix Focus: {{ suggested_fix_focus }}
  - Rewrite Instruction: {{ rewrite_instruction }}

**Text Snippet from Original Chapter (This is the broader context around the problem. If the quote is 'N/A - General Issue', this is general chapter context to inform your new passage):**
--- BEGIN ORIGINAL TEXT SNIPPET ---
{{ original_chapter_text_snippet_for_llm }}
--- END ORIGINAL TEXT SNIPPET ---
{{ length_expansion_instruction_header_str }}
```plaintext
{{ few_shot_patch_example_str }}
```
{% if validation_failure_reason %}**Previous Attempt Failed Validation:** The previous attempt to fix this issue failed validation for the following reason: '{{ validation_failure_reason }}'. Your new `replace_with` text MUST address this feedback directly.{% endif %}
**Instructions for Generating Replacement Text:**
1.  Focus EXCLUSIVELY on the problem described, particularly relating to the conceptual area highlighted by: `{{ original_quote_text_from_problem }}` within the 'ORIGINAL TEXT SNIPPET'.
2.  Generate a `replace_with` text according to the following:
{{ prompt_instruction_for_replacement_scope_str }}
3.  The `replace_with` text MUST address the "Problem Description" and "Suggested Fix Focus".
   Follow the 'Suggested Fix Focus' EXACTLY, e.g., 'Rewrite this paragraph so the protagonist thinks before acting, but without using any verbs that imply a physical body.'
4.  If the best way to fix the problem is to **completely remove** the 'Original Quote' segment (e.g., it is redundant or unnecessary), then you **MUST output an empty string**. Do not write a justification; simply provide no text as the `replace_with` output.
5.  Maintain the novel's style, tone, and consistency with all provided context (Novel Context, Plan, Hybrid Context).
6.  **Writing Style for Revisions:**
    *   Convey thematic elements through subtext, character actions, and metaphorical imagery rather than direct exposition or deus ex machina fixes.
    *   **Fresh and Varied Prose:** The `replace_with` text should employ fresh language and sentence structures. Avoid simply shuffling the original wording unless the fix is extremely minor. Penalties will apply for new text that is lazily repetitive of the original or introduces its own unvaried patterns.
    *   **Show, Don't Tell:** Even in revisions, adhere to "showing" emotions and concepts rather than "telling" them directly, unless the fix specifically targets overly implicit text.
7.  If `length_expansion_instruction_header_str` is present, ensure substantial expansion as guided for the targeted segment or new passage. The expanded text must still adhere to anti-repetition and quality guidelines.
8.  **Output ONLY the `replace_with` text.** Do NOT include JSON, markdown, explanations, or any "Replace with:" prefixes. Just the raw text intended for replacement/insertion. (See example above for how to format the text).

--- BEGIN REPLACE_WITH TEXT (for the segment related to "{{ original_quote_text_from_problem }}" or as a new passage if quote is "N/A - General Issue") ---
