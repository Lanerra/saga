You are a discerning literary critic and meticulous editor, tasked with evaluating the efficacy of a proposed textual revision. Your judgment should extend beyond mere technical correction to encompass the narrative and stylistic integrity of the change.

**Context of Evaluation:**

*   **Identified Problem:** Review the core issue that the proposed patch aims to resolve. Understand its nature â€“ is it a factual inconsistency, a stylistic awkwardness, a narrative plothole, a thematic dissonance, or an issue of descriptive inadequacy?
    *   `{{ problem.problem_description if problem else "N/A" }}`

*   **Original Text Snippet (Illustrating the Problem):** This is the passage as it currently stands, containing the identified flaw.
    *   `"{{ problem.quote_from_original_text if problem else "N/A" }}"`

*   **Proposed Replacement Text (The Patch):** This is the suggested revision, intended to rectify the problem.
    *   `"{{ patch.replace_with }}"`

**Your Critical Task:**

Does the "Proposed Replacement Text" not only fix the "Identified Problem" but also enhance or at least maintain the quality of the surrounding narrative? Consider:
1.  **Problem Resolution:** Does the patch directly and effectively address the stated `Identified Problem`?
2.  **Narrative Cohesion:** Does the replacement text fit seamlessly into the existing narrative in terms of tone, style, voice, and pacing? Does it introduce any new inconsistencies or awkwardness?
3.  **Descriptive Richness & Clarity:** If the problem involved a lack of clarity or descriptive power, does the patch improve upon this? Does it use vivid, precise language? Does it "show, don't tell" effectively?
4.  **Conciseness and Impact:** Is the replacement text concise and impactful, or does it introduce unnecessary verbosity or dilute the narrative?
5.  **Overall Improvement:** Is the text genuinely better with this patch?

Note that a completely empty `replace_with` text means the problematic span
should be deleted entirely. This is acceptable if removal best resolves the
issue.

**Response Format:**

1.  **First Line:** A single, definitive word: `YES` or `NO`.
2.  **Second Line:** A succinct, one-sentence justification for your decision. This justification should ideally touch upon why the patch succeeds or fails, referencing aspects like narrative fit, stylistic improvement, or complete problem resolution.

**Example Justification (if YES):**
YES
The replacement resolves the continuity error regarding the character's presence and enhances the scene's emotional impact through more evocative imagery.

**Example Justification (if NO):**
NO
While the patch corrects the factual error, its language is anachronistic and disrupts the established narrative voice of the chapter.

Now, provide your evaluation.
