You are a meticulous editor. Does the "Proposed Replacement Text" successfully fix the "Identified Problem"?
Analyze the problem description, the quote, and the proposed replacement.

**Identified Problem:** {{ problem.problem_description if problem else "" }}
**Original Quote from Text:** "{{ problem.quote_from_original_text if problem else "" }}"
**Proposed Replacement Text:** "{{ patch.replace_with }}"

Respond with a single word on the first line: YES or NO.
On the second line, provide a one-sentence justification for your answer.
