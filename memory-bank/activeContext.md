# Cline's Active Context

## Current Focus
- **Agent Architecture Refactoring**: Completion of knowledge agent reorganization and narrative agent enhancements
- **Output Organization**: Implementation of novel_output directory for structured output files
- **Data Tracking**: Enhanced chapter generation metrics with usage data aggregation

## Key Changes Documented
1. **Knowledge Agent Integration**:
   - `kg_maintainer_agent` fully replaced by `knowledge_agent`
   - All prompt templates migrated to `prompts/knowledge_agent/`
   - Character/world update logic consolidated in `knowledge_agent.py`

2. **Narrative Workflow**:
   - Scene planning moved from `PlannerAgent` to `NarrativeAgent`
   - `NARRATOR_MODEL` renamed to `NARRATIVE_MODEL` for consistency
   - Chapter generation now returns raw LLM output + usage data

3. **Infrastructure Updates**:
   - Log files now stored in `novel_output/saga_run.log`
   - Gitignore updated to exclude `novel_output-distillation/` and `novel_output-ontological/`

## Critical Decisions
- Removed deprecated `kg_maintainer` module (including all tests)
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing workflow paths
- Prioritized consistent naming conventions across agent modules

## Next Steps
- Validate knowledge agent output with test suite
- Audit remaining references to old agent names in documentation
- Update deployment scripts to reflect new output directory structure
