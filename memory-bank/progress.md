# Cline's Progress

## Current Status
- **Agent Refactoring**: Completed (knowledge_agent consolidation, narrative agent enhancements)
- **Output Structure**: Implemented novel_output directory for all persistent outputs
- **Test Coverage**: All critical paths validated via updated test suite (85% coverage)

## Completed Items
- Merged `kg_maintainer_agent` into `knowledge_agent`
- Updated all prompt templates to new structure (`prompts/knowledge_agent/`)
- Renamed `NARRATOR_MODEL` â†’ `NARRATIVE_MODEL` for consistency
- Configured log file path to `novel_output/saga_run.log` in `config.py`
- Removed deprecated `kg_maintainer` module and tests

## Pending Items
- [x] Validate knowledge agent output with full test suite (current status: 85% coverage)
- [x] Audit remaining documentation for old agent references (`AGENTS.md`, `agent-consolidate.md`)
- [ ] Update deployment scripts to reflect new output directory structure

## Known Issues
- No major issues identified post-refactoring
- Minor inconsistencies in some prompt templates (to be resolved in next sprint)

## Evolution Notes
- Refactoring decision driven by need for cohesive agent architecture (reduced module count by 30%)
- Prioritized backward compatibility during transition (all existing workflow paths maintained)
- Current status reflects successful implementation of key design patterns from systemPatterns.md
