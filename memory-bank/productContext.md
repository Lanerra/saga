# Product Context: Saga Knowledge Graph System

## Purpose and Problem Domain
The Saga system addresses the challenge of generating cohesive, consistent narratives across multiple chapters by maintaining a persistent world state through a knowledge graph. Traditional narrative generation systems often suffer from continuity errors and inconsistent world elements, leading to fragmented storytelling experiences.

## Core Problems Solved
1. **Narrative Inconsistency**: Ensures character traits, world rules, and plot points remain consistent across chapters
2. **Knowledge Management**: Provides structured storage and retrieval of world elements (characters, locations, items)
3. **Workflow Coordination**: Maintains proper sequencing between planning, drafting, and revision phases
4. **Transparency**: Offers detailed tracking of the narrative generation process for debugging and auditing

## System Behavior
- **Chapter Generation Workflow**:
  1. NarrativeAgent creates scene plans based on plot points
  2. Chapter content is drafted with LLM generation
  3. RevisionAgent validates continuity and quality metrics
  4. KnowledgeAgent updates the knowledge graph with new information
  5. Final output is stored in novel_output/ directory

- **Knowledge Graph Operations**:
  - Automatic detection of world element changes
  - Consistency checks across related entities
  - Enrichment of character profiles and world descriptions
  - Versioning of knowledge state changes

## User Experience Goals
- Generate coherent stories with minimal manual intervention
- Provide clear visibility into the narrative generation process
- Enable easy debugging when inconsistencies arise
- Support iterative refinement of story elements
- Maintain consistent world state across multiple chapters

## Success Metrics
- 95%+ consistency in character traits across chapters
- 90%+ accuracy in plot point execution
- Reduced manual editing required per chapter
- Clear audit trail for all narrative decisions
- Efficient debugging through comprehensive logging
