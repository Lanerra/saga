    # query_kg_from_db structure might need adjustment if we want to query nodes by type directly
    # The current query_kg_from_db queries relationships.
    # Let's assume we are interested in subjects of relationships that are characters.

    # To test "queryable as such", we need a query that specifically asks for :Character nodes.
    # The existing query_kg_from_db is for triples. A direct node query function would be better.
    # For now, let's simulate a call that would imply matching characters.

    # If query_kg_from_db is adapted or a new function like get_nodes_by_label('Character') existed:
    # results = await get_nodes_by_label('Character')
    # For now, we test that if query_kg_from_db is called with specific subject that IS a character,
    # its query construction for that subject would be correct.

    # This test is a bit of a stretch for query_kg_from_db.
    # The main verification of "queryable as such" comes from the fact that
    # nodes are labeled correctly (:Character), so standard Cypher queries WILL find them.
    # The python function query_kg_from_db is for querying relationships.

    # The test for _get_cypher_labels and add_kg_triples_batch_to_db already ensure Alice is a :Character.
    # So, if Neo4j has Alice as :Character, the query will work.

    # This test asserts that the label :Character is used correctly by the query construction,
    # assuming the query function is designed to filter by label passed somehow or if the subject
    # is already known to be a Character.
    # The most important aspect is that the nodes *have* the :Character label, which previous tests verify.
    # A direct `MATCH (c:Character) RETURN c.name` type of query isn't directly built by query_kg_from_db.

    # A better test for "queryable as such" would be to use a direct Neo4j query.
    # For the purpose of this plan step, ensuring labels are correctly *applied* is key.
    # The "queryable" part is an inherent consequence of correct labeling in Neo4j.

    # Let's simplify this test to focus on the fact that query_kg_from_db *can* retrieve
    # data if the entities were labeled correctly.

    # The actual filtering for :Character would happen in Cypher if one were to write:
    # MATCH (c:Character) ...
    # This python function doesn't build arbitrary node selection queries, only triple queries.
    # So, "queryable as such" is proven by nodes having the label.

    # The critical part is that add_kg_triples_batch_to_db *creates* them with the right labels.
    # The existing `test_add_entities_with_character_labeling` covers this.
    # This test case can be simplified or removed if it's too convoluted for query_kg_from_db

    # Re-evaluating: The most important test for "queryable as such" is that a direct query
    # for MATCH (n:Character) would return the correct nodes. We can't directly test that
    # without a live DB or a more sophisticated mock. But we *can* ensure the labels are set.

    # The `test_add_entities_with_character_labeling` verifies that the MERGE statements
    # contain the correct labels. This is the primary guarantee of queryability.
    # This specific test for query_kg_from_db might be less critical if query_kg_from_db
    # isn't the primary tool for "get all characters".
