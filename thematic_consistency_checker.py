    Placeholder function to check thematic consistency.
    In a real implementation, this would involve LLM calls or other analysis
    to compare the chapter_text against the novel's theme, genre, and character arcs.

    'agent' is an instance of NovelWriterAgent.
    Returns a string describing thematic issues, or None if consistent.

    # In a real implementation:
    # 1. Construct a prompt for an LLM.
    #    - Provide the novel's theme, genre, protagonist arc.
    #    - Provide the chapter text (or a summary).
    #    - Ask the LLM if the chapter aligns with these thematic elements.
    # 2. Call the LLM.
    # 3. Parse the LLM's response.
    #    - If issues are found, format them into a string.
    #    - If no issues, return None.

    # For now, this placeholder will always return None (consistent).
    # To test revision triggering, you could temporarily make it return an issue:
    # if chapter_number % 2 == 0: # Example: flag every even chapter for testing
