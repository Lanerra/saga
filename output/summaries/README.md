# Chapter Summaries

This directory will contain chapter summaries as they are generated.

Summaries are created automatically during chapter generation and saved as:
- `chapter_001_summary.txt`
- `chapter_002_summary.txt`
- etc.

These summaries are used to maintain narrative coherence across chapters
by providing context to the LLM during generation of subsequent chapters.
