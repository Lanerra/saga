name: Mira Sol
role: character
physical_description: Mira is lean and wiry, with a spine that bears the faint, permanent
  curve of years spent hunched over micro-scrutiny devices. Her olive skin is marred
  by faint, silvery scars along her left forearm—residual burns from a failed prototype
  nutrient-seed dispersal unit. Her eyes are an unnerving, deep amber, a genetic quirk
  from her mother’s lineage, which she hides behind thick, smudged lenses when not
  in her work zone. Her dark hair is cropped short and uneven, as if she cuts it herself
  with a dull blade. She wears a patched, high-collared synth-leather coat, its pockets
  stuffed with salvaged data chips and a chipped ceramic flask of synthetic stimulant.
  She moves with a quiet, almost furtive precision, as if afraid of being noticed.
personality: 'Mira is a study in quiet defiance. She speaks in measured, clipped sentences,
  often trailing off mid-thought as if she’s weighing every syllable. Her strength
  lies in her hyper-attentiveness—she notices minute details others overlook, from
  the flicker of a corrupted data stream to the subtle shift in a person’s breath
  when lying. But this precision is paired with deep emotional repression. She avoids
  physical contact, recoils from loud noises, and rarely makes eye contact. Her greatest
  weakness is her guilt: she helped design the first generation of the *Cicada Protocol*,
  the algorithmic culling system now used to "manage" the population. She believes
  she is complicit in the deaths of millions.'
background: Born in the third generation of Cicada Prime’s failed terraforming colony,
  Mira was orphaned at twelve when her parents died in a nutrient-purge riot. She
  was taken in by the Ministry of Population Stability and trained as a bio-architect,
  specializing in neural feedback systems. At twenty-five, she contributed to the
  development of the *Cicada Protocol*—a system that predicted individual "overpopulation
  risk" based on genetic, behavioral, and metabolic data, then triggered targeted,
  silent neurotoxin release via city-wide air filtration. When the system went live,
  it killed 3.2 million in a single month. Mira fled the Ministry, faking her death,
  and has since lived in the undercity, preserving forbidden archives of the old world—records
  of what humanity once was.
motivations: 'Mira seeks redemption through truth. She wants to expose the full scope
  of the *Cicada Protocol*, not to destroy it, but to understand it—to prove that
  the solution wasn’t inevitability, but choice. She also harbors a secret: she once
  saved one life during the purge—Kira Voss, who she believes died. Her motivation
  is personal: if she can find Kira alive, she may finally confront her past.'
skills: Expert in neural architecture and bio-data decryption; fluent in six dead
  languages; can navigate the city’s subterranean transit tunnels blindfolded; possesses
  an eidetic memory for technical schematics; highly skilled at stealth and social
  camouflage.
relationships: '-'
character_arc: 'Mira begins as a ghost of her former self—hidden, numb, and consumed
  by guilt. As she uncovers evidence that the *Cicada Protocol* was not a necessity
  but a calculated purge, she evolves from passive archivist to active rebel. Her
  arc culminates not in violence, but in revelation: she chooses to release the truth—not
  to incite chaos, but to force humanity to confront the cost of its own survival.
  She dies in silence, transmitting the final archive to the surface, her last act
  a whisper of hope.'
