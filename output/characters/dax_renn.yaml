name: Dax Renn
role: character
physical_description: Dax stands at 5'10", wiry and lean from years of subsistence
  labor, with a frame that seems perpetually coiled for motion. His skin is weathered
  and pale, etched with fine scars—some from industrial accidents, others from self-inflicted
  burns during his early days as a data scavenger. His most striking feature is his
  left eye, a milky white cataract that obscures depth perception, compensated by
  a custom ocular implant that projects real-time data overlays in his right eye.
  His hair is cropped short, gray at the temples, and frequently dusted with the fine,
  rust-colored particulate of Cicada Prime’s decaying atmosphere. He wears a modified
  bio-suit—patched and layered with scavenged tech—its fabric woven with memory-fiber
  threads that subtly shift color based on his stress levels.
personality: Dax is a reluctant pragmatist, haunted by the weight of his past decisions.
  He speaks in clipped, precise sentences, often trailing off mid-thought as if debating
  himself internally. His strength lies in his uncanny ability to read systems—social,
  mechanical, or digital—almost instinctively. He is deeply empathetic, yet emotionally
  guarded, having learned early that vulnerability is a death sentence on Cicada Prime.
  His greatest weakness is his tendency to isolate himself, believing his insights
  are too dangerous to share. He harbors a quiet, simmering guilt over a failed rescue
  mission that cost eight lives.
background: 'Born in the Undercity Slums of Sector 7, Dax was orphaned at twelve when
  a "clean-up" operation—officially labeled a "structural collapse"—wiped out his
  district. He survived by stealing data cores from dead tech-archivists and selling
  them on the black market. By 28, he was an underground information broker, known
  only as *Ghost-Link*, feeding intelligence to underground resistance cells. His
  downfall came when he uncovered evidence of the Architect’s true purpose: the mass
  "relocation" of populations via neural erasure and atmospheric dispersion. He tried
  to warn a coalition of survivors, but was betrayed. His team was executed, and he
  was left with a damaged eye and a shattered mind.'
motivations: Dax seeks redemption—not through heroism, but through truth. He wants
  to expose the Architect’s system not to destroy it, but to prove that the people
  *mattered*. He believes the only way to prevent further engineered oblivion is to
  ensure no one forgets what was lost.
skills: Expert in underground data recovery, neural interface hacking, and psychological
  profiling. Can interface with decaying city-wide networks using jury-rigged hardware.
  Possesses eidetic memory for encrypted data patterns and emotional trauma markers.
relationships: '-'
character_arc: Dax begins as a ghost of his former self, unwilling to act. By the
  story’s end, he sacrifices his own neural integrity to broadcast the full truth
  of the Architect’s work—erasing his own memories to ensure the system cannot be
  silenced again. His final act is not rebellion, but remembrance.
