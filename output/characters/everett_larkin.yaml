name: Everett Larkin
role: protagonist
description: '**Everett Larkin** is a 34-year-old survivor living on the brink in
  Cicada Prime''s decaying metropolis, a city of rusted infrastructure and perpetual
  twilight. His physical description is striking: lean and wiry at 5''11", with sunken
  eyes the color of tarnished copper that miss nothing. His skin is the color of dust,
  perpetually dirty from working in the city''s maintenance tunnels. A faint scar
  cuts through his left eyebrow from a childhood encounter with a feral scavenger,
  and his hands are calloused and scarred from years of manual labor. He moves with
  a permanent hunch, as if expecting the next structural collapse at any moment.


  Everett''s personality is defined by his cynical pragmatism and dry wit. He''s fiercely
  observant, noticing details others ignore, which has kept him alive in the dangerous
  environment. His greatest strength is his adaptability and resourcefulness, but
  his weaknesses are his tendency to isolate himself and a deep-seated distrust of
  authority. He''s sarcastic to the point of abrasiveness, using humor as a shield
  against the world''s horrors.


  Born in the city''s underbelly to a maintenance worker and a midwife who died in
  childbirth during a power surge, Everett grew up in the shadow of his father''s
  early death from respiratory failure caused by the toxic air. At 16, he was forced
  to take over his father''s maintenance route, learning the city''s hidden infrastructure
  intimately. This experience forged his survival skills but also instilled in him
  a profound disillusionment with the system that promised progress but delivered
  decay.


  Everett''s primary motivation is simple survival, but beneath this lies a deeper
  drive: the desperate need to protect those few people he still cares about. He''s
  haunted by the engineered oblivion program that he knows is happening, and his motivation
  is increasingly fueled by a desire to expose the truth and stop it, even if it costs
  him everything.


  His skills include expert knowledge of the city''s maintenance systems, mechanical
  repair, urban survival tactics, and an ability to navigate the complex social hierarchies
  of the underworld. He''s particularly adept at reading people and identifying hidden
  agendas.


  In relationships, Everett maintains a carefully guarded distance. He respects Kai
  Jensen''s street smarts but keeps their interactions strictly transactional. He
  has a complicated history with Dr. Aris Thorne, whose idealism initially annoyed
  him but whom he now sees as potentially valuable. He harbors deep distrust for Commander
  Marcus Reed, recognizing the corruption in authority, and views The Architect with
  a mixture of fear and contempt.


  Everett''s character arc begins as a survivor focused on individual preservation
  but gradually evolves into someone willing to risk everything for collective resistance
  against the oblivion program. His internal conflict centers on reconciling his hardened
  pragmatism with the moral imperative to act against the system that is destroying
  his world. The tension between his desire for safety and his growing need for justice
  forms the core of his struggle, forcing him to confront the true cost of his survival
  instincts.'
