name: Everett Larkin
role: protagonist
physical_description: Everett stands at 5'11" with a lean but wiry frame developed from years of manual
  labor and clandestine movement. His face is angular, with high cheekbones and a perpetually shadowed
  gaze that misses nothing. A pale scar runs from his left eyebrow to the corner of his mouth, a relic
  from a factory accident that ended his sister's life. His hands are calloused and capable, bearing the
  faint blue tattoos of a former laborer's guild mark now partially obscured. His most distinctive feature
  is a prosthetic left eye—cobalt blue and slightly too large for his socket—replacing the one lost during
  a confrontation with Overseer forces.
personality: Everett is methodical and analytical, observing the world around him with detached curiosity.
  He possesses a dry, understated wit that surfaces unexpectedly in tense situations. His greatest strength
  is his ability to compartmentalize—he can maintain focus during impossible circumstances and make coldly
  logical decisions under pressure. However, this same trait makes him emotionally distant and suspicious
  of overt displays of sentiment. He distrusts authority by default, having witnessed firsthand how it
  justifies horrific acts. His weakness is his inability to fully trust anyone, seeing potential betrayals
  in every interaction.
background: Everett was born in Sector 7, one of Cicada Prime's most overcrowded urban centers. His father
  died in a mining accident when Everett was twelve, leaving him and his younger sister, Maya, to fend
  for themselves. The pair survived through petty theft and scavenging until the Great Culling, when Everett
  was forced to kill a neighbor to protect Maya from Overseer enforcers rounding up "excess population."
  Two years later, Everett joined the Underscour laborers' guild, working in the toxic refineries until
  a workplace explosion claimed Maya's life. After losing his remaining eye in a subsequent riot, he spent
  three years in the underground before being recruited by the Resistance.
motivations: Everett seeks justice for the millions killed by the Overseer regime, but more fundamentally,
  he wants to understand the true nature of the "Solution"—the engineered oblivion program. He believes
  uncovering its mechanics might reveal a way to stop it or expose the lie that has justified humanity's
  descent into barbarism.
skills: Everett is an expert in urban survival and evasion, having navigated the labyrinthine underbelly
  of Cicada Prime for years. He possesses advanced knowledge of engineering and toxicology from his refinery
  work, allowing him to identify and bypass security systems. His prosthetic eye grants him limited thermal
  and spectral vision, making him invaluable for reconnaissance. He is proficient with several weapons,
  including the serrated blade he carries as both tool and weapon.
relationships: Everett has a complex relationship with Sarah Chen, the Resistance leader he both respects
  and resents for her idealism. He views Marcus Wright as a brother figure, their shared history in the
  Underscour creating an unspoken bond. He distrusts Dr. Volkov's methods, seeing her scientific approach
  as dangerously detached from human suffering. With Commander Singh, he maintains a professional respect
  mixed with personal caution, recognizing her tactical brilliance but never fully trusting her allegiance.
character_arc: 'Everett begins as a reluctant operative focused solely on survival and revenge. Throughout
  the story, he evolves into a strategic leader, gradually accepting the need to sacrifice his solitary
  methods for the greater good. His arc culminates in him making the ultimate choice: to destroy the evidence
  of the Solution''s existence to prevent its replication, even if it means sacrificing his chance for
  personal vengeance.'
