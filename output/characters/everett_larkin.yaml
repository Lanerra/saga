name: Everett Larkin
role: protagonist
physical_description: Everett is lean, wiry, and carries the quiet exhaustion of someone
  who has lived too long in the shadows. His frame is gaunt from years of rationed
  food and sleep deprivation, yet his movements are precise—like a blade honed by
  necessity. His skin is pale, etched with faint scars from old exposure to toxic
  dust storms, and his eyes—hazel with flecks of amber—are perpetually narrowed, scanning
  for threats even in stillness. A jagged scar runs from his left temple to his jawline,
  a souvenir from a failed uprising. He wears a modified exo-suit vest made from scavenged
  synth-leather, its joints creaking with each step. His hair, once dark, is now streaked
  with silver, tied back in a tight knot at the nape of his neck. He speaks in a low,
  gravelly voice, often pausing mid-sentence as if weighing every syllable.
personality: Everett is a man of quiet conviction, shaped by loss and betrayal. He
  is fiercely intelligent, analytical, and deeply empathetic—yet his empathy is tempered
  by trauma, making him emotionally guarded. He rarely speaks without purpose, and
  when he does, his words carry weight. His greatest strength is his ability to see
  systems—social, political, biological—and dismantle them with cold logic. His weakness
  is his tendency toward isolation; he believes trust is a liability, and so he pushes
  people away, even those who care. He is not a warrior by nature, but a strategist—a
  man who wins by outthinking, not outfighting.
background: 'Born in the underground arcology of Sector 7, Everett was raised on the
  edge of the collapse. His parents were engineers who worked on the failed terraforming
  project; they died in the Dust Plague of ''41, when atmospheric processors ruptured.
  Raised by a network of underground resistance cells, he was trained in sabotage,
  data encryption, and subterfuge. At 22, he infiltrated the Central Archive and discovered
  the truth: the "Plague" was engineered. Cicada Prime wasn’t dying—it was being culled.
  The Architect’s plan was to eliminate 98% of humanity through a slow, invisible
  toxin released via the water supply. Everett escaped with evidence, but not before
  losing his mentor to the purge.'
motivations: 'Everett seeks truth—not just to expose the Architect, but to understand
  why humanity was deemed unworthy of survival. He wants to give the survivors a chance
  to rebuild, not as a slave race, but as a free people. He is driven by a quiet rage:
  not for vengeance, but for the right to choose extinction—or not.'
skills: Expert in cybernetic infiltration, forensic data recovery, and psychological
  manipulation. He can bypass biometric locks with a stolen neural key, decode dead
  languages from fragmented archives, and read people’s intentions through micro-expressions.
  His greatest skill is patience—waiting, observing, and striking only when the moment
  is perfect.
relationships: '-'
character_arc: Everett begins as a solitary survivor, convinced the only answer is
  to destroy the system. By the end, he must confront the possibility that the Architect’s
  logic—while monstrous—was born from desperation. He evolves from a man seeking to
  end the cycle to one who dares to question whether survival itself is worth preserving.
