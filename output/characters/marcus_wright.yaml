name: Marcus Wright
role: character
physical_description: Marcus stands at 5'11" with a wiry, compact frame that speaks of manual labor rather
  than luxury. His skin is sun-damaged and perpetually tanned a deep bronze, with a network of fine scars
  across his knuckles and forearms from a decade working in the refineries. His face is angular, with
  sharp cheekbones and a perpetually downturned mouth that gives him a perpetually cynical appearance.
  His most distinctive feature is his left eye—lost in an industrial accident at age 19, replaced with
  a matte black ocular implant that never reflects light, making him seem unnervingly expressionless.
personality: Marcus is a survivor with a dry, sarcastic wit honed in the hellish conditions of the refineries.
  He possesses an unshakeable loyalty to those who earn it but trusts no one completely. His greatest
  strength is his pragmatism; he can assess situations quickly and make difficult decisions without sentiment.
  His weaknesses are his cynicism, which isolates him, and a simmering resentment toward authority that
  occasionally boils over into rash behavior.
background: Born in Sector 7 of Cicada Prime's largest settlement, Marcus grew up in the shadow of the
  failing terraforming project. His father died in a methane leak when Marcus was 12, leaving him and
  his younger sister to fend for themselves. At 16, Marcus joined the refinery workforce, where he spent
  the next decade maintaining the equipment that barely kept their sector functional. His accident at
  19 cost him his eye and nearly his life, forcing him to take a desk job in maintenance coordination—a
  position that makes him deeply unpopular with his former refinery colleagues.
motivations: Marcus is driven by a desperate need for stability and security for his sister, Maya, who
  suffers from a degenerative respiratory condition worsened by the planet's failing atmosphere. He wants
  to ensure she receives the best medical care possible, which means navigating the corrupt system with
  a pragmatic ruthlessness.
skills: An expert in industrial systems maintenance, Marcus can diagnose and repair equipment failures
  with almost supernatural speed and accuracy. He's a master of improvisation, able to jury-rig solutions
  from scrap materials. His time in the refineries taught him how to move through the underbelly of Cicada
  Prime unseen, and he possesses a network of low-level contacts in the black market.
relationships: Marcus maintains a strained relationship with Everett Larkin, his former refinery supervisor,
  who now holds a position in the Overseer's administration. He harbors a deep, unspoken respect for Dr.
  Elena Volkov, the medical director who treats his sister, despite their professional friction. With
  Commander Rekha Singh, he shares a wary mutual respect based on their shared history of survival in
  a collapsing system. He views High Overseer Thorne with open contempt, seeing the Overseer's policies
  as directly responsible for his sister's deteriorating health.
character_arc: Marcus begins as a cynical, isolated pragmatist but gradually evolves into the story's
  moral center. His journey involves reconciling his survival instincts with his growing ethical disgust
  at the Overseer's policies. As the narrative progresses, he transitions from a man who merely survives
  to one who actively resists the system, ultimately becoming the unlikely leader of a grassroots movement
  to expose the truth about Cicada Prime's engineered oblivion. His character arc culminates in him sacrificing
  his safety and potential position in the new order to ensure his sister receives the care she needs,
  demonstrating that loyalty and love can overcome even the deepest cynicism.
