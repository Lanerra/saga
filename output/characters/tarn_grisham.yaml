name: Tarn Grisham
role: character
physical_description: Tarn is a wiry man with the gaunt frame of someone who’s lived
  too long on recycled rations. His face is etched with fine, permanent lines—less
  from age, more from chronic fatigue and the strain of constant surveillance. One
  eye is a milky, clouded implant, the result of a failed neural interface experiment
  during his tenure at the Central Bioregulation Hub. The other, a sharp, amber-colored
  eye, remains unnervingly alert. His hair is cropped short and streaked with premature
  gray, often tucked beneath a frayed thermal cap. He moves with a subtle limp from
  an old injury—crushed vertebrae during a collapsed ventilation shaft incident in
  the undercity. His hands are stained with ink and old solvent, a testament to his
  clandestine work with salvaged data crystals.
personality: 'Tarn is a man of quiet desperation, haunted by guilt and reluctant to
  act, yet capable of fierce loyalty when pushed. He speaks in measured tones, often
  trailing off mid-sentence, as if rehearsing his words in silence before uttering
  them. His strength lies in his meticulous memory and deep understanding of the system
  he once served—its flaws, its blind spots. His greatest weakness is his paralysis
  in the face of moral choice: he knows the truth, but fears the cost of speaking
  it. He’s not brave, but he is *honest*, which in the grim world of Cicada Prime
  is a radical act.'
background: Born in the Overcrowded Sector 9, Tarn was selected at 16 for the Bioregulation
  Corps due to his aptitude for genetic modeling. He helped design the first generation
  of "Harmony Strains"—genetically modified organisms intended to suppress human fertility
  and promote rapid decomposition in death. He later discovered the strains were being
  weaponized to accelerate population reduction through engineered illness. When he
  tried to report it, his file was erased, and he was reassigned to the Undercity
  Maintenance Corps, where he spent two decades scrubbing bio-contaminated ducts.
  After a near-fatal exposure to a corrupted air filter, he was deemed unfit for service
  and left to survive in the ruins beneath the city.
motivations: To atone for his complicity. He wants to ensure the truth about the engineered
  oblivion—how the "natural" decay of Cicada Prime was manufactured—is preserved,
  even if no one listens. He seeks redemption not through action, but through *memory*.
skills: Exceptional memory for technical schematics and biometric data; fluent in
  four dead dialects of the old Earth; adept at decrypting corrupted data from pre-collapse
  archives; skilled in stealth maintenance and bypassing surveillance grids.
relationships: '-'
character_arc: Tarn begins as a man who believes truth is irrelevant—what matters
  is survival. By the story’s end, he sacrifices his anonymity, leaking a final data
  burst that exposes the full scale of the engineered oblivion, knowing he won’t live
  to see its consequences. His arc is not one of heroism, but of *witnessing*—he becomes
  the archive, not the voice.
