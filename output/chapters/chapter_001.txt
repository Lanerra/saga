The fluorescent lights of Everett Larkin's apartment hummed a monotonous dirge, a sound that had become the soundtrack to his life for the past six months. At thirty-seven, he was beginning to show the wear of it—graying hair at his temples, permanent shadows under his eyes that no amount of sleep could erase. He leaned against the kitchen counter, staring into a steaming cup of bitter black coffee that tasted more like fuel than beverage. His reflection stared back from the dark surface: tired eyes, a jaw set in a perpetual line of tension.

"Another day," he muttered to the empty apartment, his voice rough from disuse.

Everett's life had once been simple. He was an accountant, a man who found comfort in numbers and order. His days were structured: wake up at six, coffee, drive to the office where he spent eight hours balancing ledgers and reconciling accounts, come home, cook something simple for dinner, watch television until bedtime. Predictable. Safe.

That predictability had shattered three months ago when his sister, Maya, had vanished without a trace. The police had found no evidence of foul play—no forced entry, no struggle marks, just an empty apartment and her cat wandering the streets alone. Everett had been the one to find her phone lying on the floor in the living room, the screen dark.

He pushed himself away from the counter and walked to his bedroom, where a framed photo of him and Maya sat on the nightstand—her bright smile, his more reserved one. He ran a hand over it, then picked up the folded piece of paper tucked inside the frame. It was a list she'd made years ago, before her disappearance, of things she wanted to do in life.

*Visit Iceland.*
*Learn how to play the guitar.*
*Publish a novel.*
*Find someone to share my life with.*

The last item felt like a cruel joke now. Everett had tried everything—hired private investigators who charged exorbitant fees and produced nothing but dead ends, filed missing person reports, even reached out to her friends in other cities. The only consistent thread connecting the disappearances was the strange symbol that had started appearing everywhere: a simple circle with three intersecting lines, like a triskele but cleaner. He'd seen it etched into doorframes of buildings where people had gone missing, drawn hastily on sidewalks near empty lots, even once on his own car windshield after he'd parked it in the company garage overnight.

"Everett?" The voice from the living room was muffled, as if coming through a wall or door.

He froze, his hand stilling mid-caress of the photo frame. That couldn't be—his apartment was empty except for him. He crept toward the sound, his bare feet silent on the linoleum floor. When he reached the doorway to the living room, he saw nothing but the couch where he'd left a half-read magazine earlier that morning.

"Hello?" he called out again, louder this time.

Silence.

Relief washed over him briefly—he was losing his mind, that much was clear. But then another thought struck him: what if it wasn't just his mind? What if there was something else happening in the city, something the news hadn't reported yet?

That night, Everett couldn't sleep. He lay in bed staring at the ceiling, his mind racing with possibilities. The symbol kept appearing in his thoughts—some kind of mark, some kind of code. Maybe it was a cult thing? Or worse—a government experiment gone wrong? His sister had always been interested in conspiracy theories, but he'd never taken them seriously.

The next morning, Everett woke to the sound of sirens wailing down the street. He threw on his robe and hurried to the window, peering out between the blinds. Across the street, police cars were clustered around a building he recognized—Maya's apartment building.

His heart hammered against his ribs like a trapped bird. Without stopping to think, he grabbed his keys and was out the door, running down the hallway toward the elevator. He reached the ground floor just as it was opening, stepping inside and pressing the button for Maya's floor.

The ride up felt interminable. When the doors finally opened, Everett saw a uniformed officer standing outside her apartment door, talking to someone in a lab coat. The symbol was visible on a piece of paper tucked under the officer's arm—definitely the same triskele-like mark he'd been seeing everywhere.

"Hey!" he called out, approaching them.

The officer turned, hand instinctively moving toward his radio. "Sir, you can't be in here."

"I live across the hall," Everett said, gesturing toward his own apartment. "What's going on? Is it about Maya?"

The officer's expression softened slightly. "Mr. Larkin? I'm sorry for your loss, sir. We found something in Miss Larkin's apartment that we need to process."

"Can I see it?" Everett asked.

"I don't think so, sir. It's evidence."

"But it was my sister's place," Everett insisted. "I should be able to—"

Before he could finish, a second officer emerged from Maya's apartment, carrying a small plastic bag. Inside was what looked like a strange device—part organic material, part metallic components, with glowing crystals embedded in it.

"Found this tucked away in the back of her closet," the officer said, holding it up.

Everett stared at it, his blood running cold. It was beautiful and terrifying at the same time—something between a biological specimen and advanced technology. And it was definitely connected to whatever had happened to Maya and the other disappearances.

"I need to see this," Everett said again, stepping closer.

The officer holding the device glanced at his partner, then back at Everett. "Sir, I really think you should let us handle this."

"But it's my sister!" Everett's voice cracked. "I have a right to know what happened to her!"

The second officer sighed, stepping forward. "Look, we found something else too. Your sister had been researching... unusual phenomena. We found notes and files on her computer about disappearances, strange symbols, and theories about dimensional travel."

Everett's mind reeled. Dimensional travel? That was the kind of thing Maya would be interested in—she'd always been fascinated by science fiction and fringe theories.

"We think she might have stumbled upon something dangerous," the officer continued. "Something that could have gotten her killed."

"Or taken her somewhere else," Everett whispered, a new possibility forming in his mind.

The first officer handed Everett a copy of a document they'd found on Maya's desk. It was a research paper titled "Anomalous Events and Temporal Displacements in Urban Environments." Everett skimmed through it quickly, taking in the technical language about quantum physics, parallel universes, and theoretical portals between dimensions.

"This... this is her work?" he asked, disbelief creeping into his voice.

The officer nodded. "She was brilliant. We're still trying to understand what she discovered."

Everett looked back at the device in the plastic bag, then at the research paper in his hands. The symbol appeared on both—a simple circle with three intersecting lines that seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy.

"I need to help," Everett said suddenly. "I can't just sit here and wait for answers. I'll be in your way if you don't let me see this."

The officers exchanged a glance, then the first one sighed again. "Alright, Mr. Larkin. We can show you around the evidence room later today. But for now, we need to secure this device and process it properly."

"Thank you," Everett said, relief washing over him briefly.

As he watched them drive away with their findings, Everett felt a strange mix of hope and fear. Maybe Maya wasn't gone forever. Maybe she had found something incredible—a way to travel between dimensions. But what price had that discovery come at? And what was happening to all the other people who had disappeared?

He turned back toward his apartment, but as he reached for the door, something caught his eye—a small piece of paper tucked under it, half-hidden by the frame. He bent down and picked it up, unfolding it carefully.

It was a note, written in Maya's neat handwriting: *They're watching me. I know what they want. Don't trust anyone.*

Everett's hands trembled as he read the words again and again. His sister had been afraid. She had known she was in danger. And she had left him with no explanation.

He pushed the door open and stepped inside, closing it behind him and locking it for the first time in months. The fluorescent lights hummed their monotonous dirge once more, but now Everett heard something else too—a faint beeping sound coming from his sister's room, from inside her closed door.

Slowly, carefully, he approached it, his heart pounding against his ribs like a trapped bird.
