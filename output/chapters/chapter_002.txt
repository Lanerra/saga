The rain fell in sheets against the window of Everett's cramped apartment, each droplet tracing a frantic path down the grimy glass like tiny prisoners attempting escape. It was the third night without sleep for him, not that he'd been trying. His mind was a maelstrom of fragmented images: his sister Maya's smile, her eyes wide with wonder during their childhood visits to the observatory; the sterile, empty silence of her apartment last Tuesday; and now, the haunting contents of the safe he'd forced open that morning.

The device on his worktable hummed with a low, insistent energy that vibrated through his fingertips. It was no mere calculator or data storage unit. Everett had traced its origins to a black budget project called "Project Chimera," mentioned in passing by a colleague at his old accounting firm before he'd been quietly let go. The notes were worse—written in Maya's precise hand but with equations and diagrams that made his head ache. She wasn't just investigating dimensional travel; she was proposing it as a solution to the city's disappearing citizens.

"Maya, what have you done?" he whispered to the empty room, running a hand through his unwashed hair. The government had always been oppressive, but this... this was something else entirely. They were eliminating people not just for dissent or non-compliance, but because they didn't fit into whatever new world order they were constructing. And his sister—his brilliant, compassionate sister—had either joined them or discovered their secret and paid the price.

The knock at his door startled him, making him drop a data chip onto the floor with a soft clatter. He scrambled to pick it up, his heart pounding against his ribs like a trapped bird. It was too late to pretend he wasn't home. The door creaked open to reveal two men in crisp black suits, their faces impassive as they surveyed the disarray of Everett's living space.

"Everett Larkin?" one of them asked, their voice devoid of warmth.

"Yes," Everett managed, trying to keep his trembling hands out of sight behind his back. "What can I do for you?"

The man produced a photo ID that looked official but somehow felt wrong. "We're with Public Safety. We need to speak with you about recent unauthorized activities at your sister's residence."

Everett's stomach churned. They were here because of the safe. They knew.

"I haven't been there since last week," he said, the lie tasting bitter in his mouth. "My sister went missing three days ago. I was just checking on her place."

The second man stepped forward, his eyes scanning the room with predatory interest. "We have reports of forced entry at that location, Mr. Larkin. That would make you an accessory to whatever crime occurred there."

Everett's mind raced. He could lie, deny everything, but then they'd take him in and he'd never find Maya. Or he could tell the truth—that he'd broken into his own sister's apartment because she wouldn't answer his calls—and risk whatever consequences that brought. Neither option was good.

"Can I see your warrant?" he asked, his voice steadier than he felt.

The first man produced a document that looked official but had no case number and no signature. "We have standing orders to investigate disappearances in this sector," he said vaguely. "Your sister's recent research into dimensional physics makes her a person of interest."

Everett's blood ran cold. They knew about the notes. They knew everything.

"I'm going to call my lawyer," Everett said, turning toward his bedroom where his phone sat on the nightstand.

The second man moved with surprising speed, blocking his path. "That won't be necessary. We just need to ask a few questions."

"Questions don't require you to block someone's path," Everett retorted, pushing past him toward his phone.

As he reached for the device, the first man moved with lightning speed, snatching it from the nightstand and disconnecting it from the wall. "No communication devices during our conversation," he said smoothly.

Everett watched in horror as they began searching his apartment—turning over furniture, emptying drawers, examining his computer. They were looking for evidence of what? Of knowing about Project Chimera? Of trying to find his sister?

"I need to know where she is," Everett insisted, desperation creeping into his voice. "Maya wouldn't just disappear without telling me."

The second man paused in the doorway to the bathroom, holding up a small data chip similar to the one Everett had found in Maya's safe. "This belongs to your sister, correct?"

Everett stared at it, his heart seizing in his chest. "Yes, but—"

The man tossed it into a small plastic bag with others they'd collected. "It contains research that violates Section 14 of the National Security Act. Possession of such materials is punishable by indefinite detention."

"Indefinite?" Everett repeated, the word hitting him like a physical blow.

The first man nodded curtly. "Your cooperation is required to help us locate your sister and secure these dangerous materials before they fall into the wrong hands."

Everett felt trapped, cornered by forces he didn't understand but somehow knew were responsible for his sister's disappearance. The device on his worktable continued its low hum, a constant reminder of the truth he'd uncovered and the danger it posed.

"I'll cooperate," Everett said, his voice barely above a whisper. "But I want to know everything."

The men exchanged a glance, and the first one produced a small tablet from his pocket. "There's more to this than you understand, Mr. Larkin. Your sister wasn't just researching dimensional travel. She was close to discovering how to access other realities—realities where people have already been eliminated for being different."

Everett stared at him, disbelief warring with the growing horror in his heart. "You're saying the government is eliminating people who don't fit some... some ideal?"

The second man stepped forward, his expression unreadable. "We're cleaning up the timeline, ensuring a future where diversity doesn't threaten stability. Your sister understood this, which is why she was offered a position on the Chimera project."

"She would never have worked for you," Everett said with certainty. "She was an accountant. She cared about people."

The first man's expression softened slightly. "People are different now, Mr. Larkin. The world is changing, and not everyone can adapt. Your sister saw this coming, which is why she tried to find another way."

Everett felt his resolve hardening despite the fear gripping him. "If you have her, I want to see her. Now."

The second man's hand moved toward the door. "That will be discussed later. For now, you'll come with us to answer some questions."

As they led Everett from his apartment, he glanced back at the device still humming on his worktable—a silent witness to the terrible truth he'd uncovered and the even more terrifying reality that awaited him beyond the building's walls. The rain continued to fall, washing away the footprints of their departure and leaving behind only questions and the haunting image of his sister's empty apartment, now a crime scene in the eyes of a government that would stop at nothing to maintain its vision of a "pure" future.
