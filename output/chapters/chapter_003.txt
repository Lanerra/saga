The sterile white lights of the interrogation room hummed overhead, a sound as relentless as Dr. Thorne's questions. Everett Larkin sat across from him, the former accountant now a suspect in his own life's disappearance. His hands, bound not by metal but by implication, rested on the polished table between them. Outside this windowless box, the city continued its business—cars honking, sirens wailing in the distance, the unknowing masses going about their lives while Everett wrestled with a truth that could unravel everything they thought they knew.

"I understand you're grieving," Thorne said, his voice measured, almost sympathetic. He leaned forward slightly, his eyes—sharp and calculating—fixing on Everett's. "Your sister was a brilliant woman. Her work on dimensional travel wasn't just theoretical; it was dangerous." The word hung in the air, heavy with implication.

Everett thought of Maya—her laugh, her relentless curiosity, the way she'd see possibilities where others saw only problems. "She wasn't trying to travel anywhere," he said, his voice rougher than he intended. "She was trying to find people. My sister wouldn't have participated in something that could harm others."

Thorne smiled, a thin, humorless expression. "That's what you believe now. But facts suggest otherwise." He produced a data-slate from his briefcase, sliding it across the table. Everett saw columns of numbers, equations, and notes about energy signatures and quantum fluctuations—terms he barely understood but recognized from Maya's research papers. "Your sister was close to discovering how to stabilize dimensional portals," Thorne continued. "The implications... they could have destabilized entire sectors of the city."

The hum of the lights seemed to grow louder, or maybe it was just Everett's pulse quickening in his ears. He thought of the disappearances—people vanishing from their homes, from the streets, with no explanation. The authorities had always said they were runaways, or that they'd moved away without notifying anyone. But now Everett knew better. They hadn't moved; they'd been taken. Or worse.

"Your sister's research would have made her a threat to our vision of progress," Thorne said, his tone shifting from sympathetic to accusatory. "That's why she was removed."

Removed. The word echoed in Everett's mind, cold and clinical. They hadn't killed her? Or had they? He thought of the empty apartment, the silence where her research should have been. Had she been taken to continue her work elsewhere? Or had she been silenced when her questions got too close to the truth?

"I need your cooperation," Thorne said, leaning back and steepling his fingers. "We're working on a new initiative—Project Clean Sweep. We're going to eliminate all threats to our future vision. That includes anyone who might follow in your sister's footsteps."

Everett felt a chill that had nothing to do with the room's temperature. He thought of the people disappearing, the government's secret plans, the moral rot beneath this gleaming technological facade. His desire for truth warred with the fear coursing through him—fear for himself, for his remaining family, for anyone who might get in the way of whatever this was.

"I won't help you," Everett said, surprising himself with the strength in his voice. "My sister wasn't a threat. She was trying to find answers."

Thorne's expression hardened. "That's not how history works here. History is written by those who control the future." He stood up, smoothing his jacket. "You have a choice: cooperate and help us build a better world, or resist and join your sister in disappearing."

As Thorne turned to leave, Everett caught sight of a photograph on his desk—Maya in a lab coat, smiling beside a man Everett didn't recognize. Was that her collaborator? Or someone else entirely? The question gnawed at him as the door clicked shut, leaving him alone with the data-slate and the suffocating weight of what he now knew.

The sterile white lights seemed to dim, or maybe it was just Everett's vision narrowing. He took a deep breath, his fingers unconsciously tapping against the table. His sister was gone, possibly dead, definitely taken from him. But something in him refused to accept this as the end. The truth was out there, fragmented and hidden, and he would find it—no matter what it cost him.

He reached for the data-slate, his fingers brushing against the cool surface. The numbers and equations seemed to mock him now, symbols of knowledge that could either save or destroy everything. Everett's thumb hovered over the activation button, caught between the fear of what he might discover and the terror of doing nothing.

Outside the interrogation room, agents in dark suits moved through corridors, their faces impassive. Above them, the city continued its relentless march forward, unaware of the darkness brewing beneath its gleaming surface. Everett thought of all the people who had vanished, of his sister's research, of the secret projects being conducted in the shadows—and he made a decision.

The button clicked.

Everett's fingers flew across the data-slate's interface, pulling up Maya's notes and equations with desperate speed. The hum of the lights faded into the background as he delved deeper into her work, his accountant's mind now a weapon against the bureaucracy that had taken his sister. Somewhere in these numbers lay the truth—about dimensional travel, about the disappearances, about what Project Clean Sweep really was.

He didn't have much time. Thorne would return, and Everett would have to choose again between compliance and resistance. But for now, he had something else: purpose. The desire for truth had never been more urgent, and Everett Larkin—former accountant, grieving brother—was determined to find it, no matter the cost.

The data-slate glowed in the dim light as Everett's fingers continued dancing across its surface, racing against time itself.
