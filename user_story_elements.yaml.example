# SAGA Story Elements File (YAML Example)
# This file outlines the core elements of the story.
# It's recommended to use lowercase_with_underscores for keys if you want them
# to match the output of the previous Markdown parser without needing normalization.
# Otherwise, the load_yaml_file function can normalize them.

novel_concept:
  title: "Chronoscape Drifters" # Quotes optional for simple strings, good for strings with special chars

  logline: "[Fill-in: A concise one-sentence summary of the story]"
  themes:
    - "Determinism vs. Free Will"
    - "The weight of memory"
    - "[Fill-in: Other prominent themes]"

protagonist:
  name: "Jax Xenobia"
  description: |-
    A jaded ex-temporal agent, haunted by a mission gone wrong.
    He now runs a dusty antique shop, "The Hourglass Curios,"
    which serves as a front for his discreet work finding lost things (and people) across timelines.
    He's cynical but still driven by a hidden sense of justice.
  traits:
    - "Perceptive"
    - "Witty (Dry Humor)"
    - "Resourceful"
    - "Haunted by past failures"
    - "[Fill-in: A unique skill or flaw]"

  relationships:
    lila_veridian: # Using normalized keys directly in YAML is cleaner
      name: "Lila Veridian"
      status: "Presumed lost in the 'Chronos Rift' incident."
      details: "Jax's former partner and romantic interest. Her disappearance is a major catalyst for his current state."
    the_fixer:
      name: "The Fixer"
      status: "Active"
      details: "A mysterious, information broker who operates outside temporal laws. Jax's primary contact for 'off-the-books' temporal assignments. Their relationship is transactional and wary."
    # Add other key relationships as needed, e.g.:
    #警部_k:  # Example of a non-English key, if needed (YAML supports Unicode)
    #  name: "Inspector K"
    #  status: "Antagonist / Ally?"
    #  details: "A temporal police inspector who's sometimes on Jax's tail, sometimes needs his help."

setting:
  primary_setting_overview: |-
    A multiverse of intersecting timelines, policed (somewhat ineffectively) by the Temporal Concord.
    Time travel is possible but strictly regulated, leading to black markets and temporal anomalies.
    The aesthetic blends futuristic tech with noirish, decaying cityscapes.
  key_locations:
    - name: "The Hourglass Curios"
      description: "Jax's antique shop, filled with anachronistic items. Contains a hidden temporal displacement unit."
      atmosphere: "Dusty, quiet, shadows, ticking clocks."
    - name: "Temporal Hub Prime"
      description: "A vast, crystalline city existing outside normal spacetime. Once the bustling center of temporal regulation, parts of it are now abandoned and dangerous."
      atmosphere: "Sterile, imposing, echoes of past activity, temporal distortions in abandoned sectors."
    - name: "The Chronos Rift"
      description: "A chaotic, unstable region of spacetime where Lila was lost. Entry is forbidden."
      atmosphere: "Dangerous, unpredictable, visually disorienting."
    - "[Fill-in: Another key location]"

plot_elements:
  inciting_incident: "[Fill-in: The event that kicks off the main plot for Jax]"
  key_plot_points: # List of major turning points or events
    - "Jax receives a cryptic message related to Lila."
    - "An investigation leads him to a restricted timeline."
    - "Confrontation with a shadowy organization manipulating time."
    - "[Fill-in]"
  central_conflict: "[Fill-in: The main struggle Jax faces, e.g., Man vs. System, Man vs. Past]"
  stakes: "[Fill-in: What Jax (and possibly others) stand to lose]"

style_and_tone:
  narrative_style: "First-person (Jax's perspective) OR Third-person limited"
  tone: "Noir, reflective, suspenseful, with moments of dark humor."
  pacing: "Generally fast-paced during action, slower during investigative and reflective moments."

# Optional: For more complex world-building elements if not covered by KG
# world_specifics:
#   magic_system_or_technology:
#     name: "Temporal Displacement Units (TDUs)"
#     rules:
#       - "Require significant energy, prone to temporal drift if not calibrated."
#       - "Extended use can cause 'chronal sickness'."
#     limitations:
#       - "Cannot easily change 'fixed points' in time."
#       - "Travel to 'erased' timelines is extremely hazardous."
