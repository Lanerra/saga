Jax Xenobia didn’t expect the device to activate again. Not after the first time—when it had flickered to life with a low hum, casting golden light over the cluttered shelves of *The Hourglass Curios*, and shown him Lila’s final moments in a way that felt more like a memory than a vision. But here it was, sitting on the pedestal in the center of his shop, pulsing faintly, as though waiting. He had left it untouched since then, buried beneath layers of dust and doubt, but now it stirred with an energy that made the air feel heavier. The shop had always been quiet, a place where time seemed to slow, where the scent of old paper and ozone clung like a phantom. But tonight, the silence felt different—too still, too expectant.

He reached for it, fingers brushing against the cold metal casing. The device was no larger than a pocket watch, its surface etched with symbols he didn’t recognize. They glowed faintly now, pulsing in sync with the rhythm of his heartbeat. He had seen similar markings before—on the files from the Concord, on the fragments of data Dr. Varen Kael had shared with him, but never this close. Never so vivid.

The shop was dim, lit only by the flickering neon sign above the door and the soft hum of the antique clockwork mechanisms that lined the walls. Jax had spent years keeping them running, each one a relic from a different timeline, each one whispering secrets in its own way. But tonight, the device stood out. It didn’t just hum—it *breathed*, as if it were alive and waiting for something.

He hesitated, then pulled it closer. The symbols seemed to shift under his gaze, rearranging themselves like ink in water. A cold shiver ran down his spine. He had no idea how the device had ended up here, but he did know one thing: it was connected to the fracture.

And now, it was showing him something new.

The moment the device clicked into place, Jax felt a jolt—not physical, but a pull from deep within. It wasn’t just the echoes anymore. This time, the vision came with clarity, with weight, with a sense of *presence* that made his breath catch in his throat.

He saw Lila again, but not as he had before. This time, she was standing in the middle of a city that didn’t feel like any he recognized. The skyline was jagged, buildings leaning at impossible angles, streets twisting into themselves like ribbons. It was a Fracture Zone—something he had only ever read about in the Concord’s archives. A place where time unraveled and reality became unstable.

Lila looked up from the ground, her face streaked with soot and blood. The air around her shimmered, as if the world itself were trying to hold its shape. She turned toward him, and for a moment, he felt like he could hear her thoughts, like they were echoing in his mind—not just her voice, but the weight of her emotions. Guilt. Fear. Determination.

“You didn’t do it, Jax,” she said, her voice trembling. “I did.”

He blinked, the vision fading as quickly as it had come. The shop was silent again, but he could still feel the heat of it in his chest. He stumbled back from the pedestal, his hands shaking. This wasn’t just another echo. It was *real*. Or at least, more real than any before.

The device sat there, untouched, its glow dimming slightly as if it had used up its energy, but Jax could feel the pulse of something deeper beneath the surface—something that had been waiting. The way it hummed now was different, not the distant, dissonant sound of a machine awakening, but a low, resonant vibration that seemed to vibrate through his bones. He had always thought the device was just another relic, another artifact from a time he had long since abandoned. But as he stared at it, he realized it was more than that. It was a key. A key to something he had never been meant to see.

The symbols on its surface were no longer just etched in cold metal. They seemed to shift and ripple like water, responding to the faintest tremor in the air. Jax's fingers itched to trace them, to feel their texture, to understand the meaning behind them. He had seen similar markings before—on the files from the Concord, on the fragments of data Dr. Varen Kael had shared with him, but never this close. Never so vivid. They were a language he didn’t know, yet somehow, he felt they were speaking to him.

He stepped back, his breath coming in shallow bursts. The device wasn’t just showing him Lila’s echo anymore. It was showing him something else—something that had been buried in the corners of his mind, a piece of the mission he had long since forgotten. The symbols weren’t just from the fracture; they were from the very moment it had begun. A moment he had never remembered, but now, it felt like it was pulling at him, demanding to be known.

He turned the device over in his hands, the weight of it surprising. It was heavier than he expected, as though it carried the burden of something long hidden. The glow flickered again, and for a brief second, he saw the city—*Temporal Hub Prime*, the crystalline headquarters of the Temporal Concord. He had only ever seen it in fragments, in old reports and corrupted data. But now, he could see it clearly.

The realization hit him like a thunderclap. The device wasn’t just revealing the fracture to him. It was revealing *himself* to him. It was showing him that the fracture wasn’t just an accident, but a test. A test of his resolve, of his ability to remember. And if he couldn’t remember, then he would never be free from the echoes that had haunted him for so long. Jax stared at it, his mind racing. He had always believed that the fracture was his fault—that he had failed to protect the timeline in some way, and now it was punishing him with visions of what he had done. But this… this suggested something else entirely.

He wasn’t the cause. Lila was.

But how?

The thought sent a chill through him, deeper than the one from the device. He had spent years trying to forget that night, trying to convince himself that it wasn’t his fault. That he had been following orders, that he had done what he was told. But if Lila had done it… then who had told her? And why?

He turned away from the pedestal, rubbing his temples as if that might help him untangle the thoughts. The shop felt different now—like it had been waiting for this moment. Like it had been holding its breath.

A flicker of light caught his eye. He looked up, and for the first time in what felt like forever, he saw the neon sign above the door. It read *The Hourglass Curios*, but the letters were shifting, as if they were trying to rearrange themselves into something else. His pulse quickened.

He had always known that the shop was an Eddy Reality, a place where time moved at a different pace than the outside world. But now, it felt like more than just a sanctuary. Like a trap. Or a test.

He stepped away from the device, his mind still reeling. The echo had left him with more questions than answers. And he wasn’t sure if he wanted to find them.

---

The shop was quiet, but Jax’s thoughts were anything but. He moved through the aisles of dusty relics, his fingers trailing along the spines of books and the edges of strange artifacts that didn’t belong to any one timeline. Each one held a fragment of history, a whisper from another world. But none of them could explain what he had just seen.

He finally stopped at the device, crouching down to examine it more closely. The symbols were still there, but now they seemed almost *alive*, shifting and reforming in patterns that felt deliberate. He traced them with his fingertips, and a strange sensation coursed through him—like the device was responding to his touch, like it was trying to tell him something.

He had never seen these symbols before. Not in any of the Concord’s records, not in the files he had studied, not even in the archives of the fractured timelines that Dr. Varen Kael had shown him. They were different—more intricate, more deliberate. As if they had been crafted with a purpose.

A memory surfaced, unbidden and sharp. He was standing in a lab, surrounded by humming machines and glowing screens. There had been a mission, a directive from the Concord to “stabilize” a timeline that was on the verge of collapse. He had followed it, as he always did. But something had gone wrong.

He didn’t remember the details. Not the faces of the people involved, not the exact words of the orders, not even the outcome. Only fragments—Lila’s voice, a flash of light, the feeling of something *shattering* in his mind.

“You were never meant to remember,” he whispered, more to himself than anyone else. But as he said it, the symbols on the device flared briefly, and he felt a strange sense of clarity. Like they had been trying to tell him this all along.

He stood up abruptly, knocking over a stack of books in his haste. They scattered across the floor, pages flipping open like startled birds. He ignored them, his mind fixated on the symbols. They were from the mission. From the fracture. That much was clear.

But if they were from the mission, then why had he never seen them before? Why had the Concord buried them so deep?

He stepped closer to the device, his breath shallow as he reached out again. This time, the glow intensified, and a new image formed in his mind. It wasn’t Lila this time. It was a city—*Temporal Hub Prime*, the crystalline headquarters of the Temporal Concord. He had only ever seen it in fragments, in old reports and corrupted data. But now, he could see it clearly.

It was vast, its spires reaching into the sky like frozen lightning. The streets were lined with machines that pulsed with energy, their purpose unknown to him. And at the center of it all, a massive structure loomed—a tower of shifting light and shadow, its surface etched with the same symbols he had just seen on the device.

He exhaled sharply. “This is where it happened,” he muttered.

The realization hit him like a blow. He had always thought the fracture was something that had happened in the past, something he had been powerless to stop. But now, he saw it differently. It wasn’t just an accident. It wasn’t just the result of his failure. It was *planned*.

He didn’t know how he knew that. It wasn’t a memory—it was a feeling, like the device had unlocked something inside him. A part of his mind that had been sealed away. He had no idea what it was, but it was clear now that the symbols weren’t just from the mission. They were *part* of it.

He looked down at the device again, fingers hovering over the glowing surface. “What am I supposed to do with this?” he asked himself, more out of frustration than curiosity.

The answer came not in words, but in a sudden, overwhelming sense of urgency. He had to find out more. He had to understand what had happened. But the thought of digging into the past made his stomach twist. All those years of silence, of denial, of trying to forget—it had been a kind of protection. A way to keep from being consumed by the guilt.

He reached for the device again, and this time, it *reacted*.

The symbols flared, and the shop around him seemed to warp. The walls stretched and twisted, the floor beneath his feet rippling like water. Jax staggered back, his breath coming in short gasps as he tried to steady himself. He had seen echoes before, but never like this. Never with such clarity.

And then, he saw her.

Lila stood in the center of the room, her form flickering between solid and translucent. Her eyes were on him, filled with something that wasn’t quite anger, not quite sorrow—just *presence*. A presence that made his chest tighten with an emotion he hadn’t felt since the day she vanished.

“You can see me now,” she said, her voice echoing in his mind as much as in his ears. “But you won’t remember.”

He shook his head, his fingers twitching at his sides. “I *do* remember,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “Or I will, if I keep looking.”

She stepped closer, the air around her thickening like fog. “You don’t understand what you’re dealing with, Jax. You think this is about your guilt. But it’s not. It’s about *choice*.”

He frowned, his mind racing. “Choice?”

She nodded, and for a moment, he saw something else—something that wasn’t part of the echo. A shadowy figure standing just beyond her, its form shifting like smoke. Jax had seen that before. The Watcher. One of Cohort Zero’s agents. He had no idea how it got here, or why it was watching him now.

But Lila didn’t seem to notice. She turned to face him fully, her expression unreadable. ...omething *shattering* in his mind.

“You were never meant to remember,” he whispered, more to himself than anyone else. But as he said it, the symbols on the device flared briefly, and he felt a strange sense of clarity. Like they had been trying to tell him this all along.

He stood up abruptly, knocking over a stack of books in his haste. They scattered across the floor, pages flipping open like startled birds. He ignored them, his mind fixated on the symbols. They were from the mission. From the fracture. That much was clear.

But if they were from the mission, then why had he never seen them before? Why had the Concord buried them so deep?

And at the center of it all, a massive structure loomed—a tower of shifting light and shadow, its surface etched with the same symbols he had just seen on the device.

He exhaled sharply. “This is where it happened,” he muttered.

The realization hit him like a blow. He had always thought the fracture was something that had been *done* to him, something he had been forced to live with. But now, that truth felt like it was *doing* something to him. Like it was trying to tell him something, or maybe *teach* him.

He looked down at the device again, fingers hovering over the glowing surface. “What am I supposed to do with this?” he asked himself, more out of frustration than curiosity.

The answer came not in words, but in a sudden, overwhelming sense of urgency. He had to find out more. He had to understand what was happening. But the thought of digging into the past made his stomach twist. All those years of silence, of denial, of trying to forget—it had been a kind of protection.

But Lila didn’t seem to notice. She turned to face him fully, her expression unreadable. “You were never meant to remember,” she repeated, softer this time. “But you *have* remembered. And that means the fracture is changing.”

He felt a cold wave of dread. “What do you mean?”

She didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she looked at the device, then back at him. “The fracture isn’t just about the past. It’s about what we choose to forget. About who gets to decide what history is allowed to exist.” “But you *have* remembered. And that means the fracture is changing.”

He felt a cold wave of dread. “What do you mean?”

She didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she looked at the device, then back at him. “The fracture isn’t just about the past. It’s about what we choose to forget. About who gets to decide what history is allowed to exist.”

Her words settled over him like a weight. He had always thought of the fracture as something that had been *done* to him, something he had been forced to live with. But now, it felt like it was *doing* something to him. Like it was trying to tell him something, or maybe *teach* him.

He looked at the device again, his fingers curling into fists. “So what do I do? Just… keep looking?”

Lila’s lips parted slightly. “No. You have to *stop running*.”

The words struck him harder than he expected. He had spent years running—literally and figuratively—from the past, from the guilt, from the truth. But now, that truth was standing in front of him.

He opened his mouth to respond, but she stepped back, her form dissolving into the air like mist. “You’ll figure it out,” she said before vanishing. “But don’t let them take you again.”

And then the shop was silent once more, save for the hum of old machinery and the distant sound of a clock ticking in time with his heartbeat.

---

Jax sat on the floor, back against the pedestal, staring at the device as if it might answer his questions. The symbols had faded now, but the feeling of their presence still lingered in his mind. He ran his hands over the surface, trying to find something—anything—that would help him understand what was happening.

The shop felt different tonight. Not just the way the air was thick with unspoken words, but the way the light seemed to shift, as if the room itself were holding its breath. He had always thought of *The Hourglass Curios* as a place of refuge, a sanctuary where time moved slowly and history didn’t demand too much of him. But now, he wasn’t sure if it was still safe.

He looked around, taking in the familiar details—the cracked mirror that reflected too many images at once, the shelves lined with artifacts from every timeline he had ever touched, the scent of old paper and ozone that clung to the air like a ghost. This place had always been a puzzle, but now it felt like part of the puzzle was missing.

He stood up slowly, his legs unsteady. The device had shown him something new—something that suggested the fracture wasn’t just a mistake, but a *choice*. And if that was true, then he wasn’t the only one who had made it.

His mind drifted to Dr. Varen Kael, to the way she had looked at him with those knowing eyes, as if she knew something he didn’t. He had trusted her for a long time, even when his instincts told him otherwise. But now, he wondered if that trust had been misplaced.

He had always thought of the Concord as an organization of order and control. A place where history was preserved, where rogue elements like himself were hunted down and erased. But what if the Concord had been part of the problem? What if they had *caused* the fracture in the first place?

The thought made his skin prickle.

He reached for his coat, then hesitated. He wasn’t ready to go out into the world again. Not after everything. But the device had shown him something he couldn’t ignore. Something that demanded action.

He stepped toward the door, the weight of the shop pressing against his back as if it were trying to hold him in place. The neon sign flickered once more, this time showing a different message: *The Hourglass Curios—Now Closed.* He blinked, but the words remained, unblinking.

A cold laugh escaped him, bitter and hollow. “Guess I’m not the only one who can’t escape the past.”

He left the shop, the door creaking behind him as he stepped into the night.

---

The city outside was a blur of neon and shadow, its streets winding like the fingers of a clockmaker’s hand. Jax moved through it with careful steps, his mind still reeling from what he had seen. He had spent years avoiding this place, avoiding the memories that clung to him like cobwebs. But now, he had no choice.

He found himself in the same alley where he had first met The Fixer. The figure stood in the shadows, its form shifting between genders and ages, a constant enigma. Jax didn’t know if it was a person or something else entirely, but the way it looked at him now—those sharp, calculating eyes—it felt like it *knew*.

“You’ve been running for too long,” The Fixer said, its voice smooth and low, as if it were speaking from somewhere far away. “But now, you’re starting to remember.”

Jax crossed his arms, his gaze steady. “I don’t know what you mean.”

The Fixer tilted its head slightly, the expression unreadable. “You saw her again. Lila. And she said something about choices and timelines changing.”

He exhaled sharply. “She did.”

The Fixer stepped forward, the air around them thickening. “Then it’s time you stopped running and started *acting*.”

Jax narrowed his eyes. “What do you want from me?”

The Fixer paused, then smiled—a slow, knowing curve of lips that didn’t quite belong to either gender. “I want you to find the truth. But I also want you to be careful. He felt a flicker of something in his chest—curiosity, maybe, or the beginnings of fear. “Who?” he whispered, the words barely audible over the hum of the shop. The Fixer’s voice echoed in his mind, but he wasn’t sure if it was the figure’s own words or something else entirely. 

The city outside was a blur of neon and shadow, its streets winding like the fingers of a clockmaker’s hand. Jax moved through it with careful steps, his mind still reeling from what he had seen.

The Fixer paused, then smiled—a slow, knowing curve of lips that didn’t quite belong to either gender. “I want you to find the truth. But I also want you to be careful. The fracture isn’t just about what happened. It’s about *who* is trying to control it.” 

He felt a chill run down his spine, not from the cold night air, but from the realization that the fracture was never just an accident. It was a test, a manipulation, a part of something far greater than he had ever imagined. And now, he wasn’t just a victim of it—he was a piece of the puzzle, a key to unlocking the truth that had been hidden for so long. It’s about *who* is trying to control it.”

He felt a flicker of something in his chest—curiosity, maybe, or the beginnings of fear. “Who?”

The Fixer didn’t answer immediately. Instead, it reached into its coat and pulled out a small, glowing disc. “This is a fragment from the mission. A piece of the puzzle that was hidden away. You need to see it.”

Jax hesitated. He had no idea what he would find, but something told him this was important.

He took the disc, his fingers brushing against its surface. It felt warm, almost alive. “What is it?”

The Fixer’s expression darkened slightly. “A reminder that you were never just a victim of the fracture. You were part of it. And now, you’re starting to see why.”

Jax looked down at the disc, his mind racing. He had always believed he was the one who had broken the timeline, but what if he wasn’t? What if the fracture had been *manipulated*?

He wanted to ask more questions, but The Fixer turned away, vanishing into the shadows as quickly as it had appeared.

“I’ll be in touch,” it said before disappearing. “But don’t let them find you again.”

Jax stared at the empty space where The Fixer had stood, his thoughts a storm of confusion and doubt. He had spent so long trying to forget, to move on, that he hadn’t realized how much of his life was tied to this one moment.

He turned back toward the shop, but now it felt like a prison rather than a sanctuary. He needed more answers. And he needed them *fast*.

---

Back in his shop, Jax sat at his desk, the disc resting on the surface beside him. He had no idea how to use it, no idea what it would show him. But something told him it was a key.

He opened the disc, and immediately, the room filled with light. Not the golden glow of the device, but a cold, blue fire that seemed to come from nowhere. The symbols on the disc flared, and for a moment, he felt as if he were being pulled into something vast and unknowable.

Then the vision came.

It was the same city again—Temporal Hub Prime—but this time, it wasn’t just a place of order. It was *chaotic*, with timelines overlapping in ways that made his head ache. He saw himself standing in the center of it all, surrounded by figures that looked like versions of himself, each one moving through different moments in time.

One version of him was arguing with a group of Concord agents. Another was running through the streets, screaming for help. Another was watching Lila vanish into light, his hands reaching for her but never quite catching her.

He saw the symbols again, now etched into the walls of the tower that loomed over the city. They were everywhere—on machines, on buildings, on people. And in the center of it all stood a figure that wasn’t *him*.

It was someone else. Someone who looked like a version of himself, but older, more worn, with eyes that held the weight of countless timelines.

“You were never meant to see this,” the figure said, its voice a mix of Jax’s own and something else entirely. “But you have. And now, you must choose.”

Jax felt his breath catch. “Choose what?”

The figure raised a hand, and for a moment, the vision shifted. He saw Lila again, but this time she wasn’t just an echo. She was *there*, standing in front of him, her expression unreadable.

“You were part of it,” she said. “But you weren’t the one who broke it.”

He blinked, trying to make sense of what he was seeing. “So who was?”

She didn’t answer. Instead, she turned toward the tower, its symbols glowing with a strange intensity. “You have to find out for yourself.”

The vision faded, and Jax was left alone in the shop, the disc still glowing on his desk.

He looked at it, then at the device. Two pieces of the puzzle. Two questions that had no clear answers.

He reached for the device again, this time with a sense of purpose. He needed to know more. He needed to understand what had happened, who had done it, and why.

But as he touched the surface, a new sensation overtook him—one that wasn’t just about seeing echoes. It was about *feeling* them. About remembering things he had never known he could.

He closed his eyes, and for the first time in years, he let himself *feel* the past.

And when he opened them again, the shop was different. The air felt heavier, the walls darker, the light from the neon sign flickering in a way that made him uneasy.

Because now, something had changed.

---

Jax spent the next few hours combing through his collection of artifacts, searching for anything that might connect to the symbols on the device and the disc. He pored over old maps, faded photographs, and forgotten journals, each one holding a piece of a puzzle he couldn’t yet put together.

The shop was full of things from different timelines—some he had found by accident, others he had acquired through trade or barter. But none of them seemed to match the symbols. Not exactly.

He found a book with a cover that looked like it had been written in another language, its pages filled with equations and diagrams that made his head hurt. He opened it, and the words began to shift, rearranging themselves into something he could understand.

It was a blueprint for the device. A design that had been lost for years, buried beneath layers of history and suppression. The symbols were part of an ancient system—one used by the Concord to *stabilize* timelines, not destroy them.

He stared at the book, his mind racing. “So they weren’t trying to stop the fracture,” he muttered. “They were trying to *control* it.”

The thought made his stomach twist. He had always believed the Concord was the last line of defense against chaos, but what if they had been the cause? What if they had used him as a tool, or worse, a test?

He closed the book with a sharp snap, his hands trembling. “I need to find Dr. Kael.”

The shop had always been a place of refuge, but now it felt like a prison. He couldn’t stay here anymore. Not when the truth was finally starting to surface.

He packed his bag quickly, slipping on his coat and stepping out into the night. The city was still the same—neon lights, shifting shadows, and the ever-present hum of time. But something in him had changed. He wasn’t just a man haunted by the past anymore. He was someone who *wanted* to understand it.

He followed the coordinates from the disc, heading toward a place he hadn’t visited in years. A place where the Concord’s remnants still lingered, where Dr. Varen Kael might be hiding.

But as he walked, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being watched.

The air felt heavier, the shadows deeper. And somewhere in the distance, a faint hum echoed through the streets—like the device, like the fracture itself.

He quickened his pace, heart pounding. He had no idea what he would find, but he knew one thing: the past was no longer something he could ignore. And if he didn’t face it soon, it would find him again.

---

Dr. Varen Kael’s workshop was hidden in a forgotten corner of the city, a place where time moved slower than usual. Jax had found it once before, during his first mission with The Fixer, and now he returned to it with a sense of urgency that made his steps heavier.

The building was old, its walls lined with books and machines that pulsed with faint energy. A sign hung above the door, reading *“The Warden’s Archive.”* He had heard rumors about it—how it was a place where the remnants of the Concord still worked in secret, trying to preserve what little of history they could.

He pushed the door open, and the smell of old paper and ozone hit him immediately. It was the same as the shop, but somehow more intense.

Dr. Kael was there, waiting for him. She stood near a table covered in blueprints and data files, her expression unreadable as she looked up from her work.

“You came back,” she said, her voice low and steady. “That’s unexpected.”

Jax stepped inside, closing the door behind him. “I had to.”

She nodded, then gestured toward the table. “Sit. We need to talk.”

He did, his hands clenched at his sides. “What do you know about the symbols?”

She looked at him for a long moment, then picked up a file and opened it. “Everything,” she said. “The symbols are part of an ancient system used by the Concord to *control* timelines. Not just stabilize them. Not just protect them. *Shape* them.”

Jax’s breath caught. “You’re saying they caused the fracture?”

She looked up, her eyes dark with something he couldn’t name. “Not exactly. They were trying to prevent it. But in doing so, they created it.”

He frowned. “What do you mean?”

She closed the file and leaned back. “The Great Timeline Fracture wasn’t an accident. It was a test. A way to see if someone could resist the Concord’s influence. You were that someone.”

Jax felt his pulse quicken. He had always thought he was the one who had broken the timeline, but now it felt like he had been *used* for something far greater.

“I didn’t know,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

She shook her head. “You did. You just couldn’t remember.”

He looked at her, searching for answers. “Why? Why would they do that?”

She hesitated, then reached into her coat and pulled out a small device—similar to the one in his shop, but different. It pulsed with the same golden light, its surface etched with the same symbols.

“This is from the mission,” she said. “It was meant to help you remember. But someone *stopped* it.”

Jax’s mind raced. “Who?”

She didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she looked at him, her expression filled with something that felt like sorrow. “The Watcher. They’re part of Cohort Zero. They believe the fracture is a necessary evil, a way to bring order to all timelines. And they think you’re a threat.”

He exhaled sharply. “So I’m not just the one who caused it. I’m *part* of the problem.”

She nodded. “You are. But you’re also the only one who can stop it.”

Jax felt his chest tighten. “How?”

She looked at him, her eyes searching his. “Because you see the echoes. Because you remember. That’s why they chose you.”

He didn’t know what to say. The weight of the truth was crushing, but he couldn’t turn away from it now.

“I need to find out more,” he said finally.

She smiled faintly. “Then we have work to do.”

They spent the next several hours going through the data files and blueprints, piecing together the fragments of what had happened. Jax felt like he was walking through a labyrinth, each step revealing something new but never quite enough to make sense of it all.

The symbols were everywhere—on the devices, on the maps, in the very fabric of time itself. They weren’t just part of a system; they were *the system*. A way for the Concord to control what history was allowed to exist, who was remembered, and who was erased.

And now, he had seen the truth. He had seen that the fracture wasn’t an accident. It was a choice. One made by those in power, one that had cost countless lives.

He looked up from the files, his mind heavy with questions. “What if I’m not the only one who can see the echoes?”

Dr. Kael’s expression darkened. “There are others. But they’ve been silenced. Or worse, *erased*.”

Jax felt a chill run down his spine. He had always thought he was alone in this. That no one else could see what he saw. But if there were others, then the fracture wasn’t just about him.

It was about the entire system.

He looked at her, his voice steady despite the fear that threatened to consume him. “Then I have to stop them.”

She nodded slowly. “You’re not the only one who can help. But you’re the only one who *can* remember.”

He clenched his fists. “I’ll do it.”

She studied him for a long moment, then reached out and placed a hand on his shoulder. “Be careful, Jax. The Watcher won’t let you go so easily.”

He looked at her, the weight of her words pressing against him like a storm. “Then I have to be faster than them.”

She smiled, though it didn’t reach her eyes. “You always were.”

As they left the workshop, Jax felt the same pull he had when the device activated. The city around him seemed to shift, as if it were trying to warn him. He could hear the hum of time more clearly now, the way it whispered through the air like a forgotten memory.

He looked at the disc in his hand, its glow steady and unyielding. It was a piece of the puzzle, but not the final one. There were still questions left unanswered, still truths that had been buried.

And he wasn’t sure if he was ready to face them.

But he knew one thing: he couldn’t ignore them anymore.

The device in his shop had shown him the truth. The symbols had revealed something he had never wanted to know. And Lila had reminded him that the past wasn’t just a burden—it was a choice.

He had made that choice now.

And there was no turning back.

Jax returned to his shop, the disc tucked safely inside his coat. He set the device on the pedestal again, its surface now glowing with an intensity that made him feel like it was *alive*.

He looked around, taking in the familiar chaos of the space. The walls, the shelves, the artifacts—each one a piece of history he had tried to forget. But now, they felt different. Like they were waiting for him to remember.

He reached for the device, his fingers hovering over its surface. “This is it,” he whispered. “The truth.”

And then, something changed.

The symbols on the device flared, and the shop began to shift. The air thickened, the light from the neon sign dimmed, and the hum of the machinery grew louder, more urgent.

He felt a presence behind him—something watching, waiting. He turned slowly, his heart pounding as he searched for the source.

And then, he saw it.

A figure stood in the doorway, its form flickering like the shadows in a Fracture Zone. It was the Watcher. Or at least, something that *looked* like the Watcher.

Its eyes were dark, filled with a kind of knowing that made Jax’s skin crawl. “You’ve been looking for answers,” it said, its voice layered with echoes.

He didn’t move. “And I found some.”

The figure stepped closer, its form shifting between genders and ages. “Then you have to decide what to do with them.”

Jax felt the weight of that question pressing against him. He had spent so long running from the past, but now he had no choice. The truth was here, waiting for him to face it.

“I’ll decide,” he said, his voice steady.

The Watcher’s expression didn’t change. “Then you’ll be erased.”

Jax’s breath caught in his throat. He had heard that phrase before—echoed in the minds of the Concord, whispered by The Fixer, and now spoken directly to him by someone who *wanted* to stop him.

He looked at the device again, its symbols glowing brighter than ever. “Then I’ll make sure I’m not forgotten.”

The Watcher’s form flickered once more, then vanished into the shadows, leaving Jax alone in the shop.

But he wasn’t alone anymore.

Because now, he knew what he had to do.

He had to find the source of the fracture. He had to uncover the truth behind the symbols. And he had to face the past—not as a victim, but as someone who *chose* to remember.

The device pulsed once more, and Jax stepped forward, his resolve unshaken.

The Hourglass Curios would always be his sanctuary. But now, it was just the beginning.
