Jax Xenobia stood in the dim light of the Fracture Zone, his reflection flickering like a broken mirror. The air around him was thick with static, as if time itself had grown weary and was trying to hold its breath. He wasn’t sure how long he’d been here—minutes, hours, or days—but the passage of time felt irrelevant. All that mattered was what he saw: a version of Lila, her face etched with sorrow, her eyes wide with something he couldn’t quite name. She stood in the center of a rain-soaked alley, her silhouette wavering between clarity and distortion, like a ghost caught in a storm.

The city around them wasn’t real. It was a construct of time, an echo of what once was, but now it was unraveling. Buildings leaned into impossible angles, their surfaces rippling as if touched by unseen hands. Rain fell in slow motion, each drop suspended mid-air before crashing down with a metallic clang. The streets were slick with something that wasn’t water, and the sound of his boots on the pavement echoed like a warning bell.

“I should’ve saved her,” he whispered, more to himself than anyone else.

Lila turned, her face shifting between familiar and alien, her lips forming words that weren’t quite there. “You let it happen.”

He took a step forward, but the ground beneath him trembled. The alley stretched before him, its walls peeling back like old parchment. He could feel the weight of every moment he’d missed—the moments where he should’ve acted, where he should’ve seen, where he should’ve been there. And now, in this place between timelines, those missed moments were clawing at him, demanding to be acknowledged.

“I know,” he said, voice hoarse. “I just don’t know how.”

Her eyes locked onto his, and for a moment, the world stilled. She wasn’t just an echo of a past event; she was something more. A message. A warning. A tether to the truth he’d been running from.

“This isn’t just a memory,” she said, her voice layered with echoes. “It’s a warning, Jax. You’re not just seeing what could have been—you’re walking through it.”

He felt the pull of the moment, the gravity of it pressing down on his chest like an anchor. The Fracture Zone had always been a place of disarray, but this was different. This was personal.

The alley seemed to stretch infinitely, and with every step he took, the rain grew louder, more insistent, as if urging him to move forward. He could hear voices—snatches of conversation, fragments of laughter, and then silence. The silence was worse. It pressed against his ears, filling them with the weight of what had been lost.

He reached out, fingers brushing the edge of a building that wasn’t there, yet felt solid beneath his touch. A flicker of light caught his eye—a small lantern hanging from a broken window, its glow dim and wavering. He stepped toward it, but as he did, the alley began to shift. The walls melted into shadows, and Lila’s form blurred before him.

“I’m not lost,” she said, her voice now layered with countless others. “I’m a message. A reminder that time doesn’t forgive. It only repeats.”

Jax closed his eyes, willing himself to focus. He had spent years in the Hourglass Curios, surrounded by relics of forgotten timelines, but this was something else entirely. This wasn’t just an artifact—it was a memory, a truth, and a reckoning.

He opened his eyes again, and the alley was gone. In its place stood a dimly lit chamber, the kind found in old, abandoned buildings: dust motes dancing in the air like fireflies, cobwebs hanging from the ceiling like prison bars, and the faint scent of ozone and decay. The walls were lined with flickering lights, each one a fragment of time, a whisper of what had been.

Lila was there, standing at the center of the room, her form solid now, though still tinged with the ghost of something more. Her eyes were filled with sorrow, but also with something else—something that made Jax’s breath catch.

“You’re not just seeing echoes,” she said softly. “You’re walking through them.”

He nodded, his throat dry. “I know. I’ve been trying to escape them for years.”

She stepped closer, and the chamber around them seemed to pulse with a heartbeat of its own. “But you can’t. They’re part of you now. And they’re part of the problem.”

The words struck him like a blow. He had spent so long trying to forget, to bury the guilt, that he hadn’t realized how much it had shaped him. “I didn’t mean to,” he said, almost to himself.

Lila’s expression softened. “You didn’t. But you still have a choice.”

Her words lingered in the air like smoke, and for a moment, Jax felt something shift inside him—not the world around him, but his own sense of self. He had spent so long trying to avoid the truth that he hadn’t realized how much it had already become a part of him. “I’m not sure I can make the right choice,” he admitted. “Every time I try, the timelines just… break.”

She reached out, her hand brushing his shoulder. “Then you have to understand why they broke. You have to see what you must know.” “You’re walking through them.”

He nodded, his throat dry. “I know. I’ve been trying to escape them for years.”

She stepped closer, and the chamber around them seemed to pulse with a heartbeat of its own. “But you can’t run from what you’ve done.”

The words struck him like a blow. He had always believed that he was the one who had failed—that he was the cause of everything that followed. But now, standing in this place where time had collapsed on itself, he wasn’t sure if he was the villain or the victim.

“I didn’t mean to,” he said, almost to himself.

Lila’s expression softened. “You didn’t. But you still have a choice.”

Her words lingered in the air like smoke, and for a moment, Jax felt something shift inside him—not the world around him, but his own sense of self. He had spent so long trying to forget, to bury the guilt, that he hadn’t realized how much it had shaped him.

She reached out, her hand brushing his shoulder. “Then you have to understand why they broke. You have to see what you must know.”

The chamber began to change again. The walls dissolved into a swirl of colors and sounds, and Jax felt himself being pulled forward, deeper into the memory he had been avoiding for so long.

Jax found himself standing in Dr. Varen Kael’s office, the same one he had visited in Chapter 2. The room was filled with old records, blinking time devices, and the faint hum of something ancient and powerful. The walls were lined with shelves that held artifacts from countless timelines—some broken, some whole, but all remnants of what once was.

Kael sat at his desk, a glass of whiskey in one hand, a file in the other. He looked up as Jax entered, his expression unreadable. There was no welcome, no reassurance—just the weight of knowing that this was a meeting with purpose.

“You’re not just seeing echoes,” Kael said, his voice low and steady. “You’re walking through them.”

Jax exhaled sharply, rubbing his temples. “I know. I’ve been trying to escape them for years.”

Kael set the file down and took a sip of his drink before speaking again. “But you can’t. They’re part of you now. And they’re part of the problem.”

Jax stepped closer, his eyes scanning the room. “What do you mean?”

Kael’s gaze never left him. “Lila isn’t lost, Jax. She’s a message from the past you ignored. She’s the last thread holding this timeline together.”

The words hit Jax like a stone in his gut. He had always thought of Lila as a memory, a ghost that haunted him. But now, standing in this office, surrounded by the remnants of time, he felt something shift inside him.

“You’re saying she’s real?” he asked, voice barely above a whisper.

Kael nodded slowly. “She is. And she’s been trying to reach you for a long time.”

Jax’s mind raced. If Lila was real, then what had he seen before? Was it just a trick of the Fracture Zone, or was there more to it?

“I don’t understand,” he said. “Why would she be here now?”

Kael leaned back, swirling his whiskey in his glass. “Because you’re the only one who can fix this. The fracture wasn’t an accident, Jax. It was deliberate. Someone wanted to test your resolve, to see if you’d still be there when the time came.”

Jax’s hands clenched at his sides. He had always believed that he was the cause of the Great Timeline Fracture, but now, with Kael’s words echoing in his mind, he wasn’t sure.

“Who?” he asked, the question barely forming before it left his lips.

Kael didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he looked at Jax, his expression grave. “Cohort Zero.”

The name sent a chill through Jax’s spine. He had heard it before, but never with such clarity. Cohort Zero wasn’t just an enemy—they were the architects of time itself, seeking to control it, to erase the chaos that came from too many diverging paths.

“They want to stabilize all timelines into one ‘optimal’ path,” Kael continued. “But they’re not just trying to fix time—they’re trying to erase it. To make sure that history doesn’t repeat itself, they’re willing to sacrifice everything.”

Jax felt his pulse quicken. He had always known that the Fracture Zone was dangerous, but he hadn’t realized how much of a threat Cohort Zero truly was.

“They think I’m a threat,” he said, more to himself than to Kael.

Kael nodded. “You are. Not because you caused it, but because you can see it. You’re the only one who has the ability to perceive the echoes of altered events. That makes you a target.”

Jax’s mind reeled. He had spent so long trying to forget, to move on, that he hadn’t realized how much he had been hunted.

“They want me dead,” he said, voice low.

Kael’s expression darkened. “They want you to stop searching. To let the past remain buried.”

Jax took a step back, his hands shaking. “Then I have to find the source of the fracture.”

Kael’s eyes narrowed. “You can’t just walk into that, Jax. You need more than just determination. You need understanding. And you need to know that time doesn’t forgive—it only repeats.”

Jax looked down at his hands, feeling the weight of everything he had done. The guilt, the regret, the fear—they were all part of him now.

“I don’t want to repeat it,” he said quietly.

Kael’s gaze softened. “Then you have to face it. You have to understand what you did and why it happened.”

Jax exhaled slowly, his mind racing with possibilities. He had spent so long running from the truth that he hadn’t realized how much of his life had been shaped by it. If the fracture was deliberate, then someone—perhaps even someone within the Temporal Concord—had tried to control time.

He looked up at Kael, his voice steady now. “I need to find the source.”

Kael nodded. “Then you need a tool. And I can help you find it.”

The Hourglass Curios was a place of quiet mystery, its walls shifting like the surface of a pond disturbed by a stone. Jax had spent years here, but never before had he felt the weight of what lay within. The shop was filled with relics from countless timelines—some ancient, some modern, and others that defied logic entirely.

He moved through the aisles, his fingers trailing over objects that pulsed with memory. A pocket watch that ticked backward. A locket that held the face of a woman who had never existed. A compass that pointed not north, but to the moment before time itself.

At the back of the shop, behind a curtain of dust and shadows, he found it—a small, unassuming box, its surface worn and cracked. He reached for it, his fingers trembling as they brushed against the wood.

At the back of the shop, behind a curtain of dust and shadows, he found it—a small, unassuming box, its surface worn and cracked. He reached for it, his fingers trembling as they brushed against the wood. The shop had always been a place of mystery, its walls shifting like the surface of a pond disturbed by a stone. But the Shopkeeper was something else entirely. She had been a legend in the annals of the Hourglass Curios, a figure whispered about in the corners of every timeline that ever crossed this threshold. Some said she was a ghost, others claimed she was a being from a time before time. 

Yet here she was, standing in the shadows, her face obscured by a veil of light and darkness. Her presence was as much a part of the shop as the relics within it, a living embodiment of its history. 

“You’re looking for something more than just memories,” she said, her voice low, almost a whisper. “You’re looking for the truth.”

Jax looked up at her, his eyes narrowing. “And what do you know about it?”

She tilted her head, as if considering his question. “Enough to know that some truths come at a cost.”

He opened the box, revealing a small device, no larger than a coin. It was covered in symbols, some of which he recognized from Kael’s file. The surface was cool to the touch, and as he held it, a faint glow began to emanate from within.

“This piece is older than the fracture itself,” she said, her voice carrying the weight of centuries. “It doesn’t just show you what you want to see—it shows you what you must know.”

Jax turned it over in his hands, feeling the energy shift around him. It wasn’t just a tool; it was a key. A way to unlock the past, to understand the fracture, and perhaps even to stop it.

“I think I understand,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

The Shopkeeper’s eyes glowed faintly. “Then take it. But be warned—some truths are better left buried.” Her voice was low, almost a whisper.

“You’re looking for something more than just memories,” she said. “You’re looking for the truth.”

Jax looked up at her, his eyes narrowing. “And what do you know about it?”

She tilted her head, as if considering his question. “Enough to know that some truths come at a cost.”

“This piece is not older than the fracture itself,” she corrected, her voice steady. “It was created in response to it. A tool meant to help someone like you understand the damage you’ve done.”

Jax blinked, processing her words. “You mean it was made after the fracture?”

She nodded. “To show those who can see the echoes what they must do. It’s a reminder that even the smallest action can ripple through time.”

He felt something shift in his understanding. The device wasn’t just a key to the past—it was a warning, a consequence of his choices.

“This is more than just a tool,” he said, his voice low.

She smiled faintly. “It is. And it’s time you understood what it means.” “It doesn’t just show you what you want to see—it shows you what you must know.”

Jax turned it over in his hands, feeling the energy shift around him. It wasn’t just a tool; it was a key. A way to unlock the past, to understand the fracture, and perhaps even to stop it.

“I think I understand,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

The Shopkeeper’s eyes glowed faintly. “Then take it. But be warned—some truths are better left buried.”

He nodded, feeling something settle within him. This was more than just an artifact. It was a burden, a responsibility. And it was time he faced it.

---

Jax stood at the edge of the Fracture Zone, the device clutched in his hand. The air around him was thick with static and uncertainty. He had spent so long trying to escape the past that he hadn’t realized how much of his life had been shaped by it. Now, standing here, surrounded by the remnants of time, he felt something shift inside him.

He closed his eyes, focusing on the device. A pulse of energy surged through his fingers, and suddenly, the world around him dissolved into a swirl of light and sound. He was pulled forward, deeper into the echoes of the past, until he found himself standing in a rain-soaked alley, just like before.

But this time, it felt different. The alley wasn’t just an echo—it was real. And Lila was there, her eyes filled with something that wasn’t just sorrow.

“I remember now,” he said, his voice trembling. “The moment I gave up. That’s when it all started.”

Lila nodded, her expression unreadable. “You were supposed to stop them, Jax. But you didn’t. You let the fracture happen.”

He looked around, taking in the details of this reality. The buildings were familiar, but distorted. The rain fell in slow motion, each drop a reminder of what had been lost.

“I don’t know how to fix it,” he admitted.

Lila stepped closer, her voice steady. “Then you need to understand why it happened. You need to see the truth.”

He took a deep breath, feeling the weight of his past pressing down on him. He had spent so long trying to forget that he hadn’t realized how much of himself was tied to this moment.

“I did what I thought was right,” he said, more to himself than to Lila.

She looked at him, her eyes filled with something close to pity. “But time doesn’t forgive. It only repeats.”

The words struck him like a blow. He had always believed that the past was something to be left behind, but now he saw the truth—it was something he had to face.

“I can’t keep running from it,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Lila’s expression softened. “Then you have to make a choice. To forgive yourself, or to fix what you broke.”

He looked down at the device in his hand, feeling its weight. It wasn’t just a tool—it was a mirror, reflecting not just the past, but the future he had yet to face.

“I think I understand now,” he said, his voice steady. “I can’t just walk away from this. I have to see what I did and why it happened.”

Lila reached out, her hand brushing his shoulder. “Then you have to go back. You have to find the source of the fracture.”

He nodded, feeling something shift within him. The guilt, the regret, the fear—they were all part of a larger truth. And now, he was ready to face it.

---

Jax found himself standing in the Fracture Zone again, but this time it felt different. Not just chaotic, not just unstable—it felt like a battlefield, a place where time itself was fighting for control. The walls around him shimmered with fragments of past and future, each one a memory he had tried to forget.

He looked down at the device in his hand, feeling its weight. It wasn’t just an artifact; it was a key. A way to unlock the truth behind the Great Timeline Fracture. But as he reached for it, a figure appeared in the distance—a fragmented version of himself, his face split into multiple images, each one showing a different moment in time.

“I should’ve saved her,” the figure said, its voice echoing through the air like a distant bell.

Jax stepped forward, his heart pounding. “I know.”

The figure turned, its eyes locking onto him. “You let it happen. You let the fracture begin.”

He felt something inside him shift. This wasn’t just an echo of his past—it was a reflection of everything he had done. The guilt, the regret, the fear—they were all part of this moment.

“I didn’t mean to,” he said, voice trembling. “I just wanted to forget.”

The figure’s expression darkened. “Then you have to face it. You have to understand what you did and why it happened.”

Jax took a deep breath, feeling the weight of his past pressing down on him. He had spent so long trying to escape that he hadn’t realized how much of himself was tied to this moment.

“I can’t keep running from it,” he said, more to himself than to the figure.

The fragmented self smiled, though it wasn’t a real smile—it was something else entirely, like a reflection of what he had been. “Then you have to make a choice. To forgive yourself, or to fix what you broke.”

He looked around, taking in the chaos of the Fracture Zone. Time was broken here, and he was part of it. He had spent so long trying to escape that he hadn’t realized how much of his life had been shaped by this place.

“I think I understand now,” he said, his voice steady. “I can’t just walk away from this. I have to see what I did and why it happened.”

The fragmented self stepped closer, its form shifting between clarity and distortion. “Then you have to go back. You have to find the source of the fracture.”

Jax nodded, feeling something settle within him. The guilt, the regret, the fear—they were all part of a larger truth. And now, he was ready to face it.

He reached for the device, feeling its pulse. This was more than just a tool; it was a path, a way to understand what had been done and what could still be done. He had spent so long trying to forget that he hadn’t realized how much of his life depended on it.

“I think I’m ready,” he said, his voice quiet but resolute.

The fragmented self’s expression shifted, its eyes filled with something close to hope. “Then you have to choose. To move forward or to be trapped in the past.”

Jax looked around, taking in the chaos of the Fracture Zone. He had spent so long trying to escape that he hadn’t realized how much of himself was tied to this moment.

“I think I understand,” he said, his voice steady. “I can’t just walk away from this. I have to face what I did.”

The fragmented self stepped back, its form dissolving into the air like smoke. “Then you must move forward. You must find the source of the fracture.”

Jax closed his eyes, feeling the weight of everything he had done. He had spent so long trying to forget that he hadn’t realized how much of his life had been shaped by it.

“I think I’m ready,” he said, more to himself than anyone else.

He opened his eyes, and the Fracture Zone was gone. In its place stood the path forward, a way to reclaim what had been lost. He had spent so long running from the truth that he hadn’t realized how much of himself was tied to it.

“I think I understand now,” he said, his voice steady. “I can’t just walk away from this. I have to face what I did.”

He took a step forward, feeling the weight of his past behind him. The Fracture Zone had been a prison, but now it felt like a doorway. A way to move forward, to understand, and to change.

“I think I’m ready,” he said, his voice quiet but firm.

The device in his hand pulsed with light, as if acknowledging his resolve. He had spent so long trying to escape that he hadn’t realized how much of himself was tied to this moment.

“I think I understand now,” he said again, more to himself than anyone else.

He turned toward the horizon, where the lines between past and future blurred into one. The Great Timeline Fracture had been deliberate, but now he saw it for what it was—not just an accident, not just a mistake, but a choice. And he had made that choice.

“I think I’m ready to face it,” he said, his voice steady.

The device in his hand glowed brighter, as if sensing his decision. The Fracture Zone had been a prison, but now it felt like a path. A way to move forward, to understand, and to change.

He took a deep breath, feeling the weight of his past behind him. He had spent so long running from the truth that he hadn’t realized how much of himself was tied to it.

“I think I’m ready,” he said, his voice quiet but firm.

And with that, he stepped forward, into the unknown, into the echoes of the past, and into the future he had yet to find.
