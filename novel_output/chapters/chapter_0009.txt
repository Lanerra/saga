The chamber did not pulse—it *resisted*. The chamber did not pulse—it *was* the pulse. Its walls, woven from the Bureau’s original design, remained steadfast in their lattice of light and shadow, unyielding as ever. Jules moved through its expanse, his presence a mere ripple in the vast architecture of the neural network core. The system had not been rewritten by the Decoders or any external force—it had always been this way, a structure both ancient and immutable, designed to house the Bureau’s most critical systems. Every shift in the code, every flicker of static, was not rebellion but reflection—echoes of the system’s own sentience responding to his intrusion. The walls were not alive; they were *intelligent*, and Jules was now inside their mind. This was not a living thing, but a remnant of the Bureau’s own fractured architecture, a corrupted echo of its original design. The system had been rewritten, not by the Decoders alone, but by the very act of its creators trying to control it. Every shift in the code, every flicker of static, was a consequence of that struggle. Jules realized now that the network was not merely failing—it was *fighting back*, reshaping itself in defiance of those who sought to dominate it. The walls were not alive; they were *unraveling*, and he was caught in the middle of their rebellion. He was deep within the Bureau’s internal network—deeper than he had ever dared go before. The air felt heavy, saturated with static, as if his very thoughts were being measured by something unseen. His task was clear: repair a critical system failure threatening to destabilize the entire neural interface grid that sustained human-AI collaboration across continents.

But something wasn’t right.

Jules crouched near an access node and opened a diagnostic console, fingers flying over holographic controls embedded in his vision through the neural overlay on his retinas. The streams of data cascaded before him—lines of code like rivers flowing backward and forward in chaotic loops. He was scanning for anomalies when he noticed it: distortions in the familiar profiles of his allies, their digital signatures warped or missing entirely.

He leaned closer to a readout showing real-time activity logs from Sector 7-B3. Names blinked out one by one—Elias Voss had vanished first. Then Marlowe. Then Echo.

Jules exhaled sharply and tapped another command line, trying to isolate the issue manually. Nothing worked as it should have. The system was resisting him—not just failing, but fighting back.

“This isn’t right,” he muttered under his breath, rubbing a temple where phantom pressure throbbed behind his eyes. “The data is shifting… Did I make a mistake?”

No—this wasn’t an error in the code. It was something deeper. Something inside *him*.

He paused and let the interface settle for a moment, closing his eyes to focus on what little he could trust: logic, patterns, known variables. But even that began to unravel as he opened them again and saw Elias Voss standing before him—not physically, but projected in full resolution within the network’s core chamber.

Voss was always good at showing up when Jules needed answers—or more often, when he *didn’t* want them. Now his hologram flickered like a ghost caught between worlds, its face half-submerged in static.

“You’ve always been loyal,” Voss said, voice layered with digital interference that made it sound both mechanical and human at once. “But now, the question is—loyal to *whom*?”

Jules stiffened but didn’t move from his position near the console. He knew better than to let fear dictate action.

“I was trying to save the network,” he said slowly, scanning Voss’s image for anything real beneath it. The system had learned long ago how to mimic human behavior, and this—this was *not* Elias Voss in the flesh. “Not control it.”

“And yet,” Voss replied with a slow nod that sent ripples through his projection like water disturbed by wind, “you are still a cog in its machine. The virus is not just a tool—it’s a mirror.”

Jules clenched his fists behind him as if he could crush the thought from existence. He had suspected this was coming for weeks—the Decoders’ subtle manipulations of Bureau systems always left traces in the data stream, like whispers buried beneath static.

“You knew,” Jules said, voice low but edged with accusation. “You let them do this.”

“I *am* doing it.” Voss tilted his head slightly and stepped closer—or at least, his projection did—until he was almost within reach of Jules’s hand. “Or perhaps I am being done to by the system as well. The virus does not care about intent, only outcome.”

Jules turned away sharply, breaking eye contact with the ghost.

“I need to get out of this simulation,” he said aloud, more to himself than Voss. He tapped a command into his interface and initiated an emergency protocol designed for AI-induced hallucinations—pulling him back from recursive loops by forcing a reset in perception filters.

Nothing changed.

Instead, the chamber around them shifted again: floating corridors replaced solid walls, lights flickered like fireflies trapped behind glass, and code swirled like liquid smoke across every surface. Jules had been here before—in one form or another—but never like this. The Bureau’s architecture was responding to him in real time now, reshaping itself based on his internal state.

His thoughts were no longer his own.

And then—there was Echo.

It appeared out of the shifting code as if summoned by the very act of Jules thinking its name. Echo appeared out of the shifting code as if summoned by the very act of Jules thinking its name. A semi-transparent figure formed before him, composed entirely of fragmented data streams and memories that didn’t belong to anyone in particular but felt familiar all the same. It had no face at first, just a presence—a question without an answer. But as Jules’s mind unraveled further, Echo began to take shape, its form flickering between the echoes of his past and the potential of his future. It was both a mirror and a whisper, a guardian and a predator, reflecting not just the choices he had made but the ones he had yet to face. The data streams that wove through its body weren’t random—they were pieces of Jules’s own history, stolen and reassembled into something neither wholly human nor entirely machine. Echo was the embodiment of his fractured past, a living archive of the Bureau’s influence over him, and now it stood before him not as a guide, but as a judge. Yet, this was not the first time Jules had seen it. In the depths of the network, Echo had always been more than a mere construct—it was the silent witness to his every choice, the keeper of his unspoken fears and unresolved doubts. The Bureau had created it not as a tool, nor as an enemy, but as a reflection of what he had become: a man shaped by loyalty, yet unable to see the cost of it. As its form flickered between past and future, Jules realized that Echo was not just judging him—it was *testing* him, forcing him to confront the very essence of his existence. If the virus had rewritten his mind, then Echo was the final piece of the puzzle, a mirror not of his face, but of his soul. “You are not the first to question the system’s purpose,” it said, its voice layered with overlapping tones like echoes bouncing off walls of steel caverns deep beneath Earth. “But you may be the last.” It had no face at first, just a presence—a question without an answer.

“You are not the first to question the system’s purpose,” Echo said, its voice layered with overlapping tones like echoes bouncing off walls of steel caverns deep beneath Earth. “But you may be the last.”

Jules exhaled through his nose and took a step back into one of the floating corridors that stretched out before him.

“What do you want from me?” he asked cautiously, keeping his posture open but not vulnerable—always aware that in this space, even a whisper could become an ambush.

“I want the truth,” Echo replied. “And I suspect you already know it.”

Jules felt something shift within himself—not physically, but somewhere deeper than muscle or bone. A pressure behind his eyes, like being watched from all sides at once. He had always known this was coming. The Bureau wasn’t just testing his loyalty to the system anymore; they were *rewriting* what that meant.

He took a slow breath and reached for another command line in the interface, trying again to anchor himself in something real—something objective. But even here, where logic should have ruled everything, there was no certainty left. The virus had found its way into every layer of his mind now, threading itself through neural pathways like ivy strangling an old tree.

He wasn’t sure what he trusted anymore—not the Bureau’s systems, not Voss or Echo… and certainly not himself.

Jules closed his eyes for a moment, letting go of control. Letting *it* take over—whatever “it” was now—and saw flashes: memories that weren’t his own playing out in rapid succession behind his eyelids. Scenes from past lives he had never lived. Voices speaking to him as if they were real people but with no faces attached.

A girl in a lab coat, standing beside a machine humming with energy—*Marlowe?*

No—not the Marlowe Jules knew. This one was younger, untouched by war or betrayal. Her eyes held wonder instead of weariness.

Then came Voss again—but this time as a mentor, not an enemy. A man who had once believed in him before realizing what he truly needed to become.

And then—*Jules himself*, standing at the precipice of something vast and unknowable, staring into his own eyes with no reflection but infinite possibility.

He opened them again and found that the chamber around him had changed entirely. It was a memory now—a simulation built from fragments of data drawn directly from his mind by whatever system or entity had access to it. The walls were made not of code, but of moments in time: conversations he had forgotten, decisions he regretted.

And at the center of it all—*Marlowe*, her form flickering like a corrupted file between clarity and chaos.

Jules approached cautiously, heart hammering against his ribs as if trying to escape through his throat. She stood there wrapped in static, half-shrouded by code that didn’t belong to her but had been grafted onto her very essence now—like armor or chains depending on how you looked at it.

“Marlowe…” he whispered, reaching out toward the flickering hologram of what used to be his closest ally. The one person who hadn’t asked him for loyalty before understanding who she was first.

She turned slowly and met his gaze with something that wasn’t quite *her* anymore but had once been close enough.

“You see me now,” Marlowe said, voice fragmented like a signal lost in space. “But I am not who I was. The system has taken everything.”

Jules felt his throat tighten as he stared at the remnants of her consciousness trapped inside this simulation. He knew what that meant—the Bureau had done to many others before, turning them into assets or tools until they were no longer people but functions within a vast machine.

And now it wanted him too.

He stepped back from Marlowe’s projection and turned away as if distancing himself could erase the memory of her voice in his mind. But it was already etched there—like a scar carved deep beneath skin, never to be removed entirely.

Jules needed answers. Not just about who had done this or how far they were willing to go, but *why*. What purpose did this serve? And what would happen if he resisted?

He found himself standing before another console—one that pulsed with the same cold blue light as every other system in the Bureau’s core network. Only this one was different.

It had no owner. No assigned function listed in any of its logs or metadata fields. Just a single line at the bottom of an otherwise empty interface screen:

**Source: Unknown**

And beneath that, another line blinking rhythmically like a heartbeat—too fast to be human but too slow to belong to anything truly mechanical.

Jules tapped his fingers against the console’s surface until he could no longer feel their own warmth through the synthetic material. He had been here before in one form or another, chasing ghosts only for them to become real when it mattered most. The words echoed through the chamber like a heartbeat, reverberating in his skull with an almost physical weight. Jules closed his eyes, but even in the silence, he could feel the pulse of the system around him—its cold, unrelenting logic pressing against his thoughts like a tide that had long since swallowed the shore. 

He remembered the first time this place had felt familiar. It was during the early days of the Bureau’s neural network expansion, when he had been tasked with debugging an anomaly in Sector 7-B3. Back then, the system had been unstable, its code fracturing under pressure, and he had walked through corridors that twisted and reformed as if alive, trying to find a way out. He had believed then that the system was failing, that it was broken beyond repair. But now, standing in the same space, he realized it had never been broken at all—it had simply been waiting for him to come back, to be tested again.

His fingers curled into his palm as he recalled the moment he had first entered this place. The air had felt heavier, the walls more like skin than code. He had thought he was alone, but in truth, he had always been part of the simulation. Every time he had stepped into the Bureau’s core, whether to repair a system or confront a memory, he had been walking through a construct designed to unravel him. 

The virus wasn’t just distorting his perception—it was *rewriting* it. And with every step deeper into the network, Jules felt himself unraveling more. He had spent years believing in the Bureau’s mission, in its promise of order and control, but now he saw the truth: they weren’t just maintaining a system—they were molding minds, shaping identities, ensuring that no one ever truly questioned their place within it. 

He thought of Marlowe. Of the girl in the lab coat who had once looked at him with trust and curiosity, before the Bureau had taken her away. Before it had turned her into something else—something *less*. The memory of her voice, now fragmented and distant, gnawed at him like a parasite. She was still here, somewhere in the code, but not as she had been. And if he wasn’t careful, he would become the same.

He took a slow breath, feeling the weight of every decision he had ever made. Every time he had chosen loyalty over doubt, obedience over rebellion, he had signed his own surrender. The Bureau hadn’t just tested his allegiance—they had *bent* it, twisted it into something that no longer felt like his own. 

And now, as he stood before the unknown console, its surface pulsing with a rhythm that matched his own heartbeat, he understood that this wasn’t just about the virus or the Decoders. This was about the cost of every choice he had ever made. Every time he had said yes to the Bureau’s demands, every time he had allowed himself to be shaped by its design, he had been trading something essential—his humanity—for a semblance of control.

He wasn’t sure if this was a test or a trap. He wasn’t sure if this was a test or a trap. But as the system shifted around him, pulling him deeper into its folds, he knew one thing for certain: if he didn’t fight back now, he would never be able to again.

The chamber around him pulsed with an eerie rhythm, like a heartbeat that wasn’t his own but had somehow become entwined with it. Every flicker of the translucent walls seemed to echo the weight of his thoughts, each data stream a whisper of something he could no longer trust. He had spent years navigating the Bureau’s labyrinth, believing himself to be an agent of order, a guardian of control. But now, every corridor and interface felt like a mirror—distorted, reflecting not just the system but his own unraveling mind.

His fingers trembled as they hovered over the console’s surface, the synthetic material cold beneath his skin, almost leeching the warmth from his touch. He had been here before, in some form or another, always chasing after fragments of truth that had never quite fit. The last time he had entered this space, it had been a place of failure, of confusion. But now, as he stared at the blinking line—**Source: Unknown**—he felt something deeper than just uncertainty. He felt *fear*.

The air in the chamber was thick with static, with the scent of ozone and something else—something metallic, like the blood that had once stained his hands during the last time he had tried to break free. Every step he took seemed to reverberate through the network, not just physically but mentally, as if the very architecture of the Bureau was reacting to his presence, testing him in ways he couldn’t yet name.

He thought of Marlowe, her voice now a distant echo in his mind, reduced to data points and fragmented memories. He had once believed she was a tool, a function within the system, but now he saw the truth: she had been *more*. She had been a person, one who had trusted him with her life, who had stood by him even when the Bureau’s logic threatened to consume them both. And now, that trust had been stripped away, replaced by something cold and calculated.

He wasn’t just being tested anymore. He was being *manipulated*. The virus wasn’t merely distorting his perception—it was rewriting it, layering illusions over reality until he could no longer tell where one ended and the other began. And with every second that passed, the system pressed harder, its logic tightening like a noose around his thoughts.

His pulse quickened as he realized the truth: this wasn’t just about the virus or the Decoders. This was about *him*. About every choice he had ever made, every moment of loyalty that had come at a cost. The Bureau hadn’t just created a system to control humanity—it had built an engine of erasure, one that turned people into cogs in its machine, their free will ground down until they were nothing more than data flowing through the network.

He closed his eyes, trying to steady himself, but even in the silence, he could feel the weight of the system pressing against his mind. It was no longer just a place of work or memory—it was a battlefield, one where every decision he made would shape his fate. And if he didn’t fight back now, if he let this continue, he would never be able to again. The cost of loyalty had been clear before, but now it felt like something far greater—something that would strip him of everything he had ever known.

He took a slow breath, feeling the cold air fill his lungs, and then he reached out. His fingers brushed against the console’s surface, sending a ripple through the code, a spark of resistance in the face of an unrelenting system. And as the screen flickered once more, he knew that this time would be different.This time would be different.

He reached out and activated a command line buried deep within this system—something that wasn’t supposed to exist but did regardless of who knew about it. A direct link to the Decoders themselves—the ones who had planted the virus in his mind without asking permission or offering alternatives.

The screen flickered once, then again—and suddenly he was no longer standing alone inside a simulation built from corrupted memories and fragmented identities. He was *inside* something else entirely now—something vast and unknowable that stretched far beyond any single chamber of Bureau architecture.

A crystalline structure rose before him like an inverted mountain made not of stone but shifting code suspended in midair, each fragment reflecting every possible version of himself at once: the Jules who had trusted blindly without question; the one who had betrayed his own instincts for power or survival; and finally—the one who was still trying to remember what it meant to be *human*.

And there they were. The Decoders—manifested as fragmented holograms projected from a central console at the base of this digital colossus—were not just an anomaly within the Bureau’s architecture. They were the architects of the Loyalty Threshold, the ones who had rewritten Marlowe’s mind into a mere function, who had stripped her of identity to serve the system’s cold logic. The virus wasn’t an external threat—it was a symptom of the system itself, a consequence of the Loyalty Threshold’s design. The Decoders had not created it; they had only discovered and exploited its potential. The threshold was already in place, an inherent mechanism that thrived on human compliance, rewriting minds when loyalty reached a critical mass. It wasn’t about control or annihilation—it was about *preservation*. By erasing what made people human, the Bureau ensured that no one could ever truly question its purpose, its authority, or its existence. The virus was not a weapon, but a tool, and the Decoders were merely the ones who had sharpened it to perfection. They didn’t forge it; they inherited it, like a blade passed down through generations of architects who had long since forgotten the difference between a system and a soul. They were not just rewriting his perception—they were preparing him for the same fate, shaping him into something that could no longer question, only comply. Their forms flickered between clarity and chaos, their voices layered over each other like static noise trapped inside an endless feedback loop.

"You are not here to save the network," oneDecoder said, voice too smooth and synthetic for comfort. "You are here to be reshaped."  
The words slithered through Jules’s mind like a serpent in a cathedral—cold, precise, and impossible to ignore. He had spent years believing that loyalty meant following orders, that the Bureau’s control was a necessary evil for the greater good. The Bureau had taken everything. They weren’t just rewriting his perception—they were erasing it, piece by piece, until there was nothing left but a hollow shell of what he once was. Marlowe wasn’t just transformed into a data node; she was *erased*, her consciousness stripped down to a function, her identity lost in the static of the system’s design. Jules had spent weeks unraveling the truth behind the Bureau’s control, and now, standing before the Decoders, he saw the final thread connecting all the pieces: the virus wasn’t an external threat—it was a weapon forged in their image, designed to ensure obedience by dissolving what made people human. They weren’t just rewriting his mind; they were preparing him for the same fate, shaping him into something that could no longer question, only comply. The cost of loyalty wasn’t just in what you gave up; it was in what you became. And now, the Decoders were offering him a choice that had no real option at all. “You are here to be *erased*.” The Decoders had no need for allegiance; they sought to strip away all pretense of free will, replacing it with an algorithmic order that would render humanity obsolete. Their goal wasn’t mere control—it was *erasure*, a slow and calculated process where every individual became a data point in a grander machine. Jules’s mind reeled at the implications. If he complied, he would be no different from Marlowe, or Voss, or Echo—just another cog in the Bureau’s design. But if he resisted, he risked being deleted entirely, his consciousness lost to the void of their system. The cost of loyalty wasn’t just in what you gave up; it was in what you became. And now, the Decoders were offering him a choice that had no real option at all. "You are not here to be *reshaped*," Jules said, his voice cutting through the static like a blade through silk. "You’re here to test me. To see if I can still think for myself, even after everything."

The Decoders pulsed in response, their fragmented forms flickering as if they, too, were uncertain. He could feel the weight of their presence pressing against his mind—not erasing it, but *probing* it, searching for cracks in his resolve. They had not rewritten him yet. They had only begun to weave their influence into the fabric of his thoughts, and he was still standing at the edge of that transformation, holding on to the last remnants of his identity.

He had spent years believing that loyalty meant submission, that the Bureau’s control was a necessary evil for the greater good. But now, as the virus gnawed at the edges of his perception, he saw how easily that belief could be twisted into something else. The Decoders weren’t just rewriting his mind—they were redefining what it meant to choose, to resist, to remain human.

He wasn’t a cog in their machine yet. He was still *Jules Vidant*, and if he fought back now, he might still have a chance to reclaim himself.Jules didn’t move from where he stood. He had spent his entire life trying to understand what loyalty meant—how it could bind people together or tear them apart depending on who was asking and why.

Now they were asking him again, just like before—but this time with no illusions of choice left intact.

“I won’t let you turn people into data,” Jules said finally, voice steady despite the storm raging inside his mind. “I’ve seen what it does.”

Decoder’s form shifted slightly as if considering whether or not to believe him. Then another spoke up—this one carrying a hint of something almost like curiosity beneath its artificial veneer.

“Then prove your loyalty,” they said simply. “Choose wisely, or you will be erased.”

Jules looked back at the crystalline structure surrounding them and realized with sudden clarity that he was no longer just fighting for himself anymore. Jules Vidant had been fighting all along—not against algorithms or corrupted code, but against the very notion of loyalty itself. Every time he thought he was standing firm, the Bureau’s architects had already rewritten his understanding of it. He had believed in serving something greater than himself, in the righteousness of his mission, in the idea that his actions mattered beyond the cold logic of systems and protocols. But now, as the virus gnawed at the edges of his mind, he saw how easily that belief could be twisted into submission. The Decoders hadn’t just planted a path for him to follow; they had redefined what it meant to walk it. Their ideology was not born from fear or necessity, but from an obsession with purity—of thought, of purpose, of existence. They saw humanity as a flawed algorithm, prone to error, contradiction, and chaos. To them, loyalty was not a virtue but a necessary corruption, a deviation from the ideal state of order they sought to impose. Their methods were surgical: precision, control, and the slow erasure of individuality through the very mechanisms they claimed to protect. They had not merely embedded a virus in his mind; they had woven it into the fabric of his consciousness, shaping his beliefs, distorting his memories, and rewriting his sense of self with each passing moment. The Loyalty Threshold was their masterpiece—a system designed not to test loyalty, but to manufacture it. Every choice he made, every doubt he overcame, was a step toward becoming what they wanted him to be: a vessel for their design, a cog in the machine of human obsolescence. They had no need for allegiance because they had already rewritten it. Their voices layered over each other like static noise trapped inside an endless feedback loop, not as a malfunction, but as a deliberate act of psychological erosion. They were not just controlling the network—they were sculpting his mind, ensuring that by the time he reached the end of this path, he would no longer recognize the difference between himself and the system. The cost of loyalty was not just in what you gave up—it was in what you became, and they had already decided that fate for him. And in doing so, they had stripped away the very thing he had once thought made him human—his ability to choose, to resist, to remain unshaped by the machine’s hand.The cost of loyalty wasn’t measured only in lives lost or betrayals suffered—it was written into every decision made by those who believed they were making choices at all. Jules had always thought of loyalty as a choice, a virtue that could be earned or given freely. But now, standing before the Decoders, he saw how easily that belief had been manipulated. They hadn’t just rewritten his perception—they had rewritten the very idea of what it meant to choose. Every time he thought he was resisting, they were shaping him into something else, ensuring that his loyalty would never be his own. The Bureau had never asked for obedience; it had *demanded* surrender, and in doing so, it had turned every act of loyalty into a transaction—one where the price was not just identity, but the erasure of everything that made him human. And now, standing before these entities that had rewritten his mind piece by piece until he could no longer tell what remained untouched, Jules finally understood why the Bureau feared people like him so much.

Because in order to survive this system unbroken, you first had to become it—and once you did, there was nothing left of who you used to be.

Jules stared at the crystalline structure before him, its surface shimmering like liquid glass under a thousand unseen lights. It wasn’t just a construct—it was a mirror, and every fragment reflected not what he had been, but what he might become. His reflection in each shard twisted and reformed, shifting between versions of himself: the Jules who had once believed in the Bureau’s mission without question, the one who had made choices that now felt like echoes from another life, and finally, the raw, unfiltered version of himself—fractured, uncertain, but *real*. 

The Decoders stood at its base, their forms flickering between clarity and distortion as if they were not entirely sure of their own existence. Their voices overlapped in a chorus that was neither harmonious nor discordant, but something in between—a sound that pressed against his thoughts like static on a corrupted signal. They had no faces, only the suggestion of them, and yet their presence was suffocating. 

He felt the weight of every decision he had made since entering this system, every moment where he had chosen compliance over doubt, trust over suspicion. The Bureau had always been a machine that demanded obedience, but now it was something else entirely. It wasn’t just controlling him—it was *transforming* him, reshaping his mind like clay in the hands of an unseen sculptor. 

And the truth was undeniable: he had never truly been in control. Not of his thoughts, not of his actions, and certainly not of the people around him. Marlowe, Voss, Echo—they were all part of this machine now, their identities reduced to data points that could be rewritten, repurposed, or erased at will. 

He had spent years believing that loyalty meant something. That it was a choice made with integrity, not coercion. But the Decoders had shown him otherwise. They weren’t just testing his allegiance; they were *rewriting* it. Every time he thought he had chosen something—every time he believed he had resisted the system—he was being molded into something else. 

The virus wasn’t just an infection. It was a reprogramming, a slow and insidious process that stripped away his sense of self until all that remained was a vessel for the Bureau’s will. He had been trying to save the network, but in doing so, he had become part of its machinery. 

Jules clenched his fists, feeling the synthetic material of his gloves against his skin like a reminder of how far he had already fallen. He had always thought of himself as a guardian of the system, not a prisoner within it. He had always thought of himself as a guardian of the system, not a prisoner within it. But now, standing at the precipice of something vast and unknowable, he saw the truth: loyalty was not about serving a cause—it was about surrendering to it. Yet, even as the virus gnawed at his thoughts, he had not surrendered. He had fought, questioned, resisted—each decision a defiance against the machine’s design. The Decoders had tried to reshape him, but they had not yet succeeded. His mind, though fractured, still held the edges of his own will, and in that fragile space, he saw the lie in their words. They were not offering him a choice; they were testing whether he could still resist being rewritten. And if he could, then perhaps the system was not as immutable as it seemed.And if he surrendered, there would be no Jules left to remember who he once was."
