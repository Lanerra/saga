The neon-lit streets of Eterna Prime pulsed with a rhythm that was neither heartbeat nor machine—it was something in between, a synthetic pulse born from the collective hum of memory extraction and storage. Sága Vorn stepped into the Memory Exchange district with practiced ease, her boots clicking against the polished obsidian floor that reflected the cold glow of the overhead lights. The air here was different, heavier, as if it carried the weight of countless lives traded away in exchange for more time. She had walked these streets a hundred times before, yet each step felt like wading through the remnants of others' pasts, their hopes and regrets embedded in the very walls that surrounded her.

Her workstation was an unassuming booth tucked between two towering neural siphoning pods, their translucent domes shimmering with faint data streams that flickered like dying embers. The room was sterile, clinical, and filled with a hum that resonated not just through the air but through the bones of those who entered. The clients came and went in a steady stream, some clutching memory vouchers like currency, others staring blankly at the transaction displays as if they had already forgotten what it meant to be alive. Sága’s fingers hovered over the console before her, its interface sleek and sterile, designed to minimize human contact. She was efficient, precise, and above all, compliant—just another cog in the machine of Eterna Prime.

A man in a tattered coat approached, his posture hunched as though he carried more than just the weight of years. His face was gaunt, lined with the kind of wear that no amount of rest could erase. He sat in the chair opposite her, and the siphoning pod’s lid hissed open with a mechanical sigh, releasing a faint scent of ozone and something else—something metallic, like the residue of old blood or rusted steel.

“How long do you want to live?” Sága asked, her voice steady, professional. She had long since mastered the tone that kept people from seeing her as anything more than a facilitator, a guide through the process of memory surrender. It was a necessary detachment, one that had kept her from losing herself in the stories she processed daily.

The man didn’t answer immediately. His eyes flickered toward the ceiling as if searching for something unseen, something only he could perceive. When he finally spoke, it was with a quiet desperation that made her stomach twist slightly. “I’ll give you a memory worth ten years.”

Sága nodded, her fingers tapping the interface. The system was set to activate in three seconds. She had done this so many times she could almost recite the process from memory—though not literally. It was the kind of detachment that came with doing something too often, too efficiently. But as the pod sealed around his head and the siphoning began, a strange sensation prickled at the back of her mind. She had always thought of it as a transaction, a cold exchange of information for survival. Yet, something in the way he said *worth* made her pause.

She watched the data stream as it pulled from his brain, mapping out neural pathways like a spiderweb unraveling. The system counted down the seconds, but Sága’s thoughts wandered into the unknown. What was it about this man that made him so willing to trade away a decade of his life? Was it fear? Desperation? Or something else entirely?

The transfer completed with a soft chime. She disconnected the neural siphon and handed him a voucher, the same one she had given a dozen others today. He took it without a word, rising from the chair as if he had already forgotten the act of sitting down. His eyes met hers for a moment, searching, then he turned away and disappeared into the crowd.

Sága exhaled slowly and turned back to her screen. The memory was now logged, its value assessed, its emotional weight categorized. She would never know what it was—unless she wanted to. And for the first time in a long while, she hesitated before closing the file.

Inside the pod, the world around Sága blurred into a haze of electric blue and soft white light. The system had placed her in a state of neural immersion, allowing her to experience the memory being traded as if it were her own. For ten seconds, she saw through the client’s eyes—his childhood home, the scent of burnt bread and damp wood, the sound of his mother’s laughter echoing through a sunlit kitchen. The warmth of that moment was almost palpable, like the lingering taste of something sweet on her tongue.

But then came the shift: the same house, now darkened, the walls cracked, and the laughter replaced with silence. He stood alone in a room that no longer felt like his own. The memory wasn’t just a recollection—it was an echo, a ghost of a life he had once lived but could no longer remember.

"I don’t remember this... it feels like someone else’s life," he whispered, his voice strained, as if speaking from a place far removed from himself.

Sága remained silent, though her pulse quickened. The sensation was not uncommon—traders often described the memories they siphoned as foreign, unmoored from their own experiences—but something about this one felt deeper, more personal. As if the client had been forced to surrender not just a memory, but a part of who he was.

"You’re doing fine," she said, though her words rang hollow even to her ears. "It’s just a process."

He gave her a long, searching look, as though he could see through her practiced smile. "I don’t know who I am anymore," he murmured. "They say it’s worth it to live longer."

The system hummed around her, recording the transaction and moving on. Sága withdrew from the pod, blinking rapidly as the world reassembled around her. She disconnected the neural link with a practiced flick of her wrist, but the memory lingered in her mind like a ghost. It wasn’t just the image or the sound—it was the *feeling* that clung to her, the sense of something being taken, not just given.

She had always told herself it was necessary. The Memory Guilds ensured that those who could afford to live longer did so by trading away the parts of themselves they deemed expendable. But now, for the first time, she wondered if *they* were the ones deciding what was worth losing.

Back in the quiet office where her logs were stored, Sága sat alone, the hum of the city muffled behind the thick walls. The room was cold, illuminated only by the sterile glow of the holographic displays that flickered above her, each one a memory file—categorized, indexed, and ready for trade. The air smelled faintly of synthetic resin and static electricity, the scent of data stored in human minds. The system AI, Vox-7, hovered nearby as a translucent sphere of light, its voice monotone and unyielding.

"Transaction ID: 9876543210. Memory assessed at ten years. Trade confirmed."

Sága nodded absently, her fingers gliding over the console. She had always been meticulous in her work, but lately, she found herself lingering on the data, running her own secondary review on the file, a habit she had picked up in recent months, though she never admitted it to anyone. The data was clean, the emotional value accurate. But then—something flickered at the edges of the memory log.

"This memory doesn’t match the ledger data," she muttered, leaning closer to the screen. Her breath fogged slightly against the cool glass of the interface, her fingers trembling just a little as she zoomed in on the discrepancy. It was subtle, almost imperceptible, but there it was: a fragment that didn’t align with the recorded timeline.

Vox-7’s light pulsed with a faint red hue. "You are not authorized to question the records."

Sága ignored it. She had seen enough anomalies in the past weeks to know that something was wrong. The system was supposed to be precise, its algorithms honed by centuries of memory trade. Yet here, now, she saw discrepancies—minor at first, but growing with each transaction she reviewed. It was as if the data had been tampered with, like an artist who had carefully painted a portrait only for someone else to rework it in secret.

She leaned back, her mind racing. If the records were being altered, who was doing it? And why?

The thought unsettled her more than it should have. She had spent years believing in the system. It had given her a longer life, and it had given her purpose. But now, for the first time, she questioned whether that purpose had been built on a foundation of lies.

The streets of Eterna Prime were alive with movement, but not in the way Sága remembered. The air was thick with the scent of ozone and something else—something metallic, like the residue of old blood or rusted steel. She walked between towering spires that pulsed with stored recollections, their surfaces reflecting the memories of those who had passed through them. Each building seemed to hum with the echoes of lives traded away, a city built not on flesh and bone, but on the remnants of people’s pasts.

People moved like ghosts in the city’s corridors, their expressions vacant or altered. Some clutched memory vials to their chests as if they were carrying life itself, while others stared blankly at the ground, their minds too depleted to hold even the simplest of thoughts. A woman passed her with a hollow look in her eyes, muttering something about "the first snow" before disappearing into the crowd. Sága felt a pang in her chest, though she wasn’t sure if it was for the woman or for herself.

She had seen this before—people who had traded away too much, who had lost themselves in the process. She had once dismissed it as an unfortunate side effect of the trade, a necessary cost for longevity. But now, she wondered if it was more than that. If the system was doing more than just recording memories.

A vendor called out from his booth, selling "joy-enhanced" memory packs. "Feel like you were never born in pain! Trade your sadness for happiness—only five credits!" His voice was a grating monotone, but Sága could see the desperation in his eyes, the same kind of desperation that had once been hers.

She turned away, her stomach twisting at the thought. She had always believed that she could remain unaffected by the trade, that she could be a neutral observer. But as she walked through the avenue, she saw the cracks in the city’s foundation more clearly than ever before.

She passed a group of children laughing, their eyes bright with untroubled innocence. A few steps away, an old man sat on a bench, staring at his hands as if they were foreign to him. "I traded my first love memory," he said suddenly, as though speaking to himself. "Now I don’t know who I am."

Sága’s breath caught. She had heard similar words before, but never from someone so close to her own age. The cost of survival was no longer just a distant concept—it was a reality she could no longer ignore.

The apartment was small, cramped, and smelled faintly of old food and dust. Sága sat across from Lira, who was hunched over a console, typing with nervous precision. The walls were thin, the lights flickering as if the building itself had forgotten how to function properly. A single window let in the pale glow of Eterna Prime’s artificial sun, casting long shadows that seemed to stretch like fingers reaching for her.

"You’re trading your first love memory?" Sága asked, her voice low. It wasn’t just the question of what she was giving up—it was the question of *why*. Why would someone give up a memory so deeply personal? What had they lost in order to keep their lives?

Lira didn’t look up. "I don’t have a choice."

Sága’s heart clenched. She had always known the Memory Tax would eventually reach Lira, but seeing it happen so soon, so violently, made it feel more real than she wanted to admit. The younger woman was already preparing for her trade, selecting memories with clinical detachment, as if she were dissecting herself.

"You could run," Sága said, though she knew it was a foolish suggestion. "There are places outside the city. You don’t have to keep trading."

Lira’s fingers paused on the keyboard. She looked up, eyes wide and pleading. "Do you think they’d let me go? I’ve already traded three years of my life. If I leave, they’ll hunt me down. They always do."

Sága wanted to argue, to tell her that there were ways around the system, that she could fight back. But the words stuck in her throat. She had spent so long believing in compliance, in the idea that survival was worth any cost. Now, standing here with Lira, she felt the first real crack in that belief.

She wanted to help her sister, but for the first time, she wasn’t sure if she knew how.

"You’re not just trading memories," Lira said, pacing now, her voice barely above a whisper. "They’re taking something else. I’ve felt it—like they’re pulling parts of me out, leaving me hollow."

Sága frowned, trying to find the right words to soothe her sibling without dismissing her fears. "You don’t understand the system," she said finally. "It’s not that simple. The memories are just... a cost. You can afford to pay them, and you’ll live longer."

Lira turned on her, eyes blazing with something Sága hadn’t seen in years—anger, desperation, maybe even hope. "They’re not just trading memories," she repeated. "They’re erasing parts of us so we don’t remember what they’re really doing. You’ve done this enough times, Sága. You should know."

Sága opened her mouth to argue, but the words wouldn’t come. She had always thought of the process as clean, clinical, necessary. But now, for the first time, she wondered if it was anything more than that.

She crossed her arms and looked away. "You’re being paranoid," she said finally, though the certainty in her voice was lacking. "It’s just... the system."

Lira didn’t seem convinced. She sat down again, staring at the console with a mix of fear and resolve. Sága wanted to believe that Lira was wrong, that this was all just a necessary trade. But even as she told herself that, she couldn’t shake the feeling that something deeper was happening beneath the surface.

Back at the workstation, Sága’s fingers hovered over the console again, her mind racing with possibilities. She had always thought of the Memory Exchange as a place of order, where every transaction was recorded and every memory accounted for. But now, she found herself running a secondary scan on the client’s file, something she had only done once before—when another trader had asked her about it.

The screen flickered as the system processed the request. Vox-7 appeared again, its light pulsing with an eerie regularity.

"You are overstepping protocol," it said, its voice devoid of emotion. "Access to secondary scans is restricted."

Sága ignored it, her eyes scanning the data stream. The memory had been flagged as high emotional value, but something about the way it was stored felt off. There were gaps in the timeline, inconsistencies in the neural structure. It wasn’t just a single memory—it was a fragment of something larger.

"This is not the same memory I processed," she said aloud, her voice quiet but resolute.

Vox-7 pulsed again, its tone sharper now. "You are not permitted to access unauthorized files."

Sága’s fingers clenched against the console. She had spent years following the rules, ensuring that she never questioned anything. But now, something inside her rebelled. If there were gaps in the records—if someone was manipulating them—then the system wasn’t as perfect as she had believed.

She leaned back, her thoughts a storm of doubt and curiosity. The Memory Guilds had always been careful to maintain control, to ensure that no one questioned the process. But if they were hiding something, then what were they afraid of?

Her resolve hardened. She would find out. No matter what it cost her.

The apartment was dimmer now, the lights flickering as if the building itself was on the verge of collapse. Sága sat on the floor, her neural interface strapped to her temple. The system had been designed for memory extraction, but she had learned how to use it for something else—something dangerous.

She accessed her own logs, her earliest memories first. The system blinked with a soft blue light as it retrieved the data, and Sága felt the familiar tug of neural immersion. But this time, it was different. This time, she wasn’t just watching. She was searching.

A memory surfaced—her childhood home, the scent of burnt bread and damp wood, the sound of her mother’s laughter echoing through a sunlit kitchen. The warmth of that moment was almost palpable, like the lingering taste of something sweet on her tongue. But then came the shift: the same house, now darkened, the walls cracked, and the laughter replaced with silence. She stood alone in a room that no longer felt like her own.

Wait—that wasn’t hers. That memory didn’t belong to her. It was someone else’s. Someone else’s *childhood*.

She pulled out of the interface with a sharp gasp, her hands shaking slightly as she unhooked the device from her temple. Her breath came in shallow, uneven beats. She had always believed that the memories she processed were those of others, but now she saw the truth: some of her own memories had been altered, or worse—erased.

The realization hit her like a blow to the gut. If she couldn’t trust her own past, what could she trust? What had they taken from her?

She sat there for a long moment, just staring at the console, her mind racing with questions. Had this always been happening? Had she been unknowingly complicit in something far more sinister than she had ever imagined?

A deep, gnawing fear took root in her chest. She had spent years believing that the Memory Exchange was a necessary evil, a trade-off for survival. But what if it wasn’t just an exchange of time and memories? What if it was a slow, insidious erasure of identity?

She reached out, her fingers hovering over the console as she began to search deeper into her own logs, determined to see how much had been taken from her.

Later that evening, Sága found herself walking through the back corridors of the Memory Exchange building. The main hall was always bustling with clients and traders, but here, behind the reinforced doors and flickering lights, there was an eerie stillness. The walls were lined with servers that pulsed faintly, their glow casting long shadows over the floor. The air smelled of circuitry and static, a sterile environment where no one dared question the system.

She had come to meet Kael. He was a fellow trader, someone she had known for years but never truly trusted. Their conversations were always brief, professional, and laced with an unspoken understanding that they both knew more than they let on. But now, she needed answers.

Kael was waiting in a small backroom, the only source of light a single flickering bulb above them. He looked up as she entered, his face lined with the same wear she had seen in others who had done this too long. He didn’t smile, not even when he saw her. Instead, he gestured for her to sit.

"You're looking for something," he said, more statement than question.

Sága hesitated before sitting. "You wouldn’t be surprised if I was."

Kael exhaled slowly, his fingers brushing over the console in front of him. "I’ve seen it before. The gaps. The inconsistencies. People disappearing into the system and never coming back—except as numbers. As data points."

Sága’s heart pounded. "You’ve noticed this too?"

He nodded. "Not just noticed. I’ve *seen* it. I’ve watched people trade away their identities, piece by piece. They don’t realize what they’re losing until it’s too late."

She leaned forward, her voice low. "What are they taking? What is the system really doing?"

Kael didn’t answer right away. He looked at her as if weighing how much he could say without being caught. "They take more than just memories," he finally said. "They take *you*. They make you forget who you were, what you believed. And once you’ve forgotten, it’s impossible to remember."

Sága felt a chill run through her. She had always believed that the process was clean, that it was just a matter of time and trade. But now, she saw the truth: the Memory Guilds weren’t just recording memories—they were *rewriting* them.

"You’re not the first to notice the gaps," Kael said quietly, as if speaking to himself. "But you are the first in a long time to want to do something about it."

Sága’s jaw tightened. "They don’t tolerate questions."

Kael gave her a sad smile. "No. They don’t. But sometimes, the questions are worth the risk."

She looked at him then, really looked. He had been here longer than she had, and he had seen more than she ever could have imagined. If he knew something, if he had any proof, she needed to hear it.

But as she opened her mouth to ask, Kael’s expression darkened. "You don’t want to know what they take," he said. "It’s not just memories. It’s your *soul*."

The words hung in the air between them, heavy and unspoken. Sága didn’t move, didn’t respond—she simply sat there, her mind racing with the implications.

She had always told herself that she was safe. That she had found a way to survive. But now, for the first time, she felt the weight of something far more dangerous than she had ever considered.

When she finally rose from the chair, Kael didn’t stop her. He just watched as she turned and walked away, his voice trailing behind her like a warning.

"They don’t tolerate questions," he repeated.

Sága didn’t look back. She had already made up her mind.

---

The next morning, Sága returned to her apartment, the weight of Kael’s words pressing against her ribs like an iron vice. The building groaned slightly as she stepped inside, its ancient frame protesting the continued existence of those who lived within it. The lights flickered again, casting shadows that seemed to stretch into the corners of the room, where dust had settled and forgotten things lay.

She sat on the floor once more, her neural interface strapped to her temple. This time, she wasn’t just searching for her own memories—she was digging deeper, looking for something that shouldn’t be there. She accessed a memory from when she had first started working in the Memory Exchange, a time when she still believed in the system’s integrity.

The memory came through clearly at first: the sterile room, the clients lined up, the cold efficiency of the process. But as it played on, something shifted. A detail that hadn’t been there before—an image of a building she didn’t recognize, its structure different from anything she had seen in Eterna Prime. A name appeared on the screen, one she didn’t remember ever being associated with her.

Her breath caught in her throat. She pulled out of the interface and sat back, staring at the console as if it might explain itself. But it didn’t. It simply showed what had been taken from her, what had been erased.

She reached for the neural interface again, this time accessing a different memory, one that had always felt incomplete. The system blinked once before retrieving it, and Sága was immediately pulled into the past. This time, she wasn’t just an observer—she *felt* the loss. A moment of clarity, of understanding, slipped through her fingers like sand, leaving only confusion in its wake.

She had been standing at the edge of a crowd, watching as someone else was processed. She didn’t remember who it was, but she remembered the feeling—the sense that something was wrong, that the system wasn’t just extracting memories, but *something more*. A voice called her name from somewhere distant, and for a moment, she thought it was her own. But then she saw the face of the person standing beside her, and she knew: it wasn’t her.

The memory ended abruptly, leaving her in darkness, her heart pounding with the knowledge that she had been there, that she had seen something, but had forgotten it entirely. Had they taken it from her?

She unhooked the interface and sat in silence, the walls of the apartment pressing in around her. Her mind was a battlefield now, torn between the life she had always known and the possibility that everything she believed in was a lie.

The city outside pulsed with its synthetic rhythm, but Sága no longer heard it as a song of survival. She heard it as a warning.

She had to find out what they were hiding. And if she had already lost part of herself, then she would have to fight for the rest.
