The Memory Exchange was a place where time was traded like coin and where the past could be bought or sold with the flick of a wrist. Nestled deep beneath the Chrono Spire, it was a cavernous expanse of shifting shadows and cold, sterile light. The air was thick with the scent of ozone and something metallic—like the city itself was exhaling its own decay. Memory orbs floated in clusters around the booths, their soft glow illuminating faces lined with desperation, greed, or quiet resignation.

Sága sat behind her counter, fingers idly tracing the edge of a memory node as she waited for the next client. The exchange had long since become second nature to her. She had learned how to listen to the echoes of others’ lives, how to pluck out the most valuable fragments and sell them back in pieces. It was a business that required no emotion, only precision.

But today was different.

A hooded figure shuffled into the booth, their steps muffled by the thick layer of dust clinging to the floor. The walls vibrated with the low hum of memory retrieval units, but here, in this corner of the Exchange, the noise seemed distant, as if the world had been muted just for her. She watched the client lower themselves onto the chair across from her, their hands trembling slightly as they reached into a tattered satchel.

“I want to trade a memory,” the client said, their voice hoarse with something she couldn’t quite place—fear? Resolve?

Sága raised an eyebrow. “Of course. Which one?”

The figure hesitated, then pulled out a small, unmarked orb. It was unlike the ones she usually handled—no sigils, no labels. Just a dim, flickering light inside.

“It’s not just any memory,” the client said, their eyes fixed on hers. “It’s yours.”

Sága’s fingers curled around the edge of the table as if it might anchor her to reality. She had heard many strange requests before—people wanting to forget their worst days, or relive their happiest moments—but this was something else entirely.

“Mine?” she repeated, voice low. “You want to trade one of my memories?”

The client nodded slowly. “I don’t know the details. I only know that it’s a memory you’ve forgotten. But I need it.”

Sága leaned back, her mind racing. Why would someone want to trade a memory she had no recollection of? And more importantly, how could they even know such a thing existed?

Her internal monologue churned with questions, but she masked them behind a practiced neutrality.

“You don’t remember it yourself?” she asked.

The client shook their head. “I never did. But I’ve been searching for it. I think it’s the key to something bigger than me.”

Sága studied the orb in the client’s hand. It was old, she could tell by the way it pulsed with a rhythm that felt too slow, too uncertain.

“I don’t remember that,” she said finally, her voice steady. “But I’ll take it.”

She reached for the orb, and as her fingers touched its surface, a strange warmth spread through her palm. The client’s eyes widened slightly, then they handed it over without another word.

The extraction process was swift. Sága placed the orb in the retrieval unit, adjusted the settings with a practiced touch, and closed her eyes. A moment later, she was no longer in the booth but in a place that felt impossibly familiar—yet foreign.

She stood in a small kitchen, the scent of warm bread filling the air. The light from a single bulb above cast long shadows across the walls, and the sound of a child’s laughter echoed through the room. She turned, her heart pounding, trying to place the scene. It was a home. A modest one. But it wasn’t Virellis as she knew it—this was before the collapse, before the Council had taken control.

She saw herself as a child, running through the house with a younger sibling in tow. The walls were bare, the floor creaked under their feet, and outside, the world had not yet turned to ash.

Then the door burst open.

A man stepped inside, his presence like a blade cutting through the fragile peace of the memory. His uniform was dark, military-grade, and his expression unreadable. He moved with the precision of someone who had seen too many things and forgotten none.

“Where is it?” he asked, voice calm but edged with something she couldn’t name—authority, maybe. Or fear.

Her mother appeared in the doorway, her face pale, eyes wide with terror. She clutched a small bundle to her chest.

“Please, don’t take her memories,” she whispered, her voice barely audible over the sound of the child’s gasp.

The man stepped forward, his gaze falling on Sága. She felt something like a void open inside her. A cold pressure, as if someone were reaching into her mind and pulling out a part of herself. Her younger self stared up at him, silent, trembling.

She tried to scream, but no sound came out. The man touched her forehead, and the world around her collapsed in on itself. Colors bled, sounds muffled, and then—nothing.

When she opened her eyes again, she was back in the booth. Her hands were shaking, her breath coming fast. The client was gone, the retrieval unit cold and still.

What had just happened?

She pressed a hand to her chest, as if to steady the frantic beat of her heart. That memory—so vivid, so real—had felt like it belonged to her. Like she had lived it. But she had no recollection of it at all. Why would that be?

The thought gnawed at her. She had always believed her childhood was lost in the fire that had consumed the early days of Virellis. That it had been erased from history, from her mind, from everything. But this memory—it had been there all along, buried beneath layers of time and survival.

She stood abruptly, knocking over a stack of memory nodes. Her assistant, Lir, looked up from his workbench with a start.

“Sága? You okay?”

She didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she moved toward the exit, her mind churning with questions that had no answers. She needed to know more. She needed to find out where that memory came from, and why it had been taken.

The old district of Virellis was a place she rarely visited. It lay beyond the Hollow Plaza, where the city’s newer citizens gathered in neat rows to surrender their memories for yet another year of life. Here, past the towering spires and neon-lit corridors, the buildings were older—crumbling, broken, and filled with the remnants of lives that had been cast aside.

She walked through the streets, her boots crunching over broken glass and dust-covered cobblestone. The air was colder here, laced with a decay that even the underground tunnels couldn’t quite mask. Murals still clung to some walls, their colors faded, their messages barely legible. One read: *“Eternity is not a gift, it is a debt.”* Another: *“The More You Lose, the More You Gain.”*

She had heard those words before, but now they felt like a taunt.

A building caught her eye—its windows shattered, its door hanging off its hinges. She stepped inside, the floor groaning beneath her weight. Dust motes swirled in the dim light filtering through the cracks in the ceiling. It was a schoolhouse, long abandoned, its walls peeling and covered in grime.

She ran her fingers along the plaster, searching for something—anything—that might hold a clue. Then she felt it: a slight indentation in the wall, just beneath a layer of dust and time.

She dug her fingers into the crack, feeling the rough texture of the brick. Something was hidden there. She pulled with more force than she expected, and a small piece of paper slid free from the wall.

It was a child’s drawing. Simple lines, colored with what looked like crayon that had long since faded. In the center stood a girl, her face unmistakably Sága’s own. Beside her was a man in a dark uniform—Kael, she realized, the name suddenly clear in her mind.

Her breath caught. “Why would I draw this?” she whispered, staring at the image as if it might answer her.

She traced the lines with her fingertip, feeling the weight of something long buried. Kael. The name was familiar now, but only in the way a nightmare is remembered—a shadow that had always been there, just out of reach.

Her mind reeled. She had never known this man, and yet he was here, in her memory, in her drawing. What did it mean? Why had she drawn herself with him?

A whisper of doubt surfaced in her thoughts. Had the Council taken more than they admitted? Had they stolen not just memories, but pieces of identity itself?

“I need to know more,” she said quietly, as if speaking to the dust-covered walls.

The ruins around her seemed to breathe with the weight of forgotten lives, and Sága felt herself sinking into them, as though she had always belonged here, even if she didn’t remember it.

She left the schoolhouse behind and made her way toward the southern wall, where the old district ended and the Veil of Forgotten began. The Council’s records were kept in the central tower, but she had heard rumors—of hidden files, of things best left buried.

The archives were guarded by the Memory Keepers, their presence a silent warning to all who entered. She slipped through the back entrance, her heart hammering as she moved past rows of crystalline nodes and ancient data tablets. The air was thick with the hum of stored recollections, each one a life reduced to a flicker in the dark.

An archivist sat at a desk, their face hidden behind the glow of a memory orb. They looked up as she approached, eyes narrowing.

“You’re not supposed to be here,” they said, voice flat and unyielding.

Sága forced a smile. “I’m just collecting some records for my next trade.”

The archivist gave her a long, searching look before nodding stiffly. “Fine. But don’t make me regret this.”

She moved deeper into the archives, past rows of memory storage units that pulsed with the lives of those who had traded too much. She found a secluded corner, where the light was dim and the air felt heavier. There, she discovered a file marked only with her name.

“This file should not exist,” she murmured, sliding it from the shelf. Her hands trembled as she opened it.

The report inside was chilling. It spoke of an experiment conducted by the Council in the early days of Virellis, before the trade had become law. It detailed a “memory extraction incident” involving a child named Sága. The language was clinical, detached—like this had been nothing more than a routine procedure.

But she knew it wasn’t.

She read the words over and over, her mind struggling to process what they meant. They had taken her memory as a test. As a subject. She had never been just a dealer—she had been a product.

A cold rage settled in her chest. The Council had not only stolen from others but had experimented on her as a child. Had they done it to control her? To shape her into something useful?

Her hands clenched around the edges of the report. “They took it from me... but why?” she whispered, the question echoing through the silence.

She needed answers. She needed to know the whole truth.

Back in her workshop, the air was thick with the scent of old metal and the faint tang of memory fluid. Lir was working on a new retrieval unit, his fingers moving with practiced ease over the delicate wiring.

She stood behind him, watching as he adjusted the dials. The room was cluttered with half-finished projects, discarded orbs, and the remnants of lives she had once traded for survival. It was a place that should have felt safe, but now it felt like a prison.

“I need to talk to you,” she said, her voice low.

Lir paused, turning slightly in his chair. “You’re not going to ask me to trade another memory, are you?”

She shook her head. “I think I was used as a test subject by the Council.”

His expression shifted from amusement to concern. “Used? That doesn’t sound like something they’d admit.”

“I didn’t know,” she admitted, voice barely above a whisper. “But I found a file. It says they took my memory during the collapse. They were experimenting with control.”

Lir’s hands stilled on the device. He turned fully toward her now, his face pale. “If that’s true, we’re in danger.”

She stepped closer, eyes burning with determination. “I need to know what they did to me. What I was before they took it.”

“I don’t know if I can help you,” Lir said cautiously. “But I’ll try. If this is real, then we have to find out more.”

Sága nodded, her mind already racing with possibilities. She had spent years surviving on the trade, selling pieces of others’ pasts as if they were nothing more than currency. But now she saw herself in a different light. Not just a dealer, but a victim.

She returned to the site of the memory—what was left of her childhood home. The structure had been reduced to little more than a skeletal frame, its walls crumbling, vines creeping through the cracks like veins of some long-dead thing. She stepped inside, her boots crunching over debris and broken furniture.

The floorboards creaked under her weight as she searched for anything that might remain. Then she felt it again—something beneath the surface. A hidden compartment, perhaps? She knelt, pressing her hands against the wooden planks, feeling the faint outline of a door or a space.

She pried it open, revealing a small chamber beneath the floor. Dust swirled in the air as she reached inside, her fingers brushing against something smooth and cold.

It was another memory orb. Unlike the ones in the Memory Exchange, this one had no markings, no sigils of ownership. It pulsed with a quiet light, almost like it was waiting for her to find it.

“This isn’t from the Council,” she whispered, holding it up to the dim light filtering through the broken ceiling. “This is real.”

She felt something stir inside her—a connection, a recognition she couldn’t quite name. The orb seemed to hum in response, as if acknowledging her presence.

She tried to extract the memory, but the device resisted. It was strange, almost like the orb was protecting its contents from her touch.

Then, without warning, the room shifted again. Shadows deepened, and a new vision overtook her. This time, it wasn’t of herself as a child, but of her mother—standing in the same kitchen, hands trembling as she pressed something into Sága’s palm.

“I’m sorry,” her mother whispered, tears glistening in the dim light. “I had to do this for you.”

Sága stared at the memory orb now, its glow intensifying. Her mother had given up her own memories to protect her. To ensure that she would survive. That she would forget.

The realization struck her like a blade. She had been raised in silence not because of the collapse, but because of a choice made by someone who loved her. A sacrifice made so that she could live.

She closed her eyes, letting the weight of it settle in her chest. “She gave everything to keep me safe.”

The memory orb flickered again, and Sága felt something shift inside her. The fear that had ruled her life for years—of losing more, of trading away what remained—was no longer enough. She could not live with this anymore.

She returned to the Memory Exchange under the cover of night, the city above her a cold expanse of neon and steel. She didn’t know what she would find there, only that she had to confront the client who had given her the memory. They had known something she did not, and she needed to understand why.

The booth was empty when she arrived, but the moment she stepped inside, she felt it—the presence of someone watching her, waiting for her to arrive. She turned, her breath catching as the client stood in the shadows, their hood lowered now, revealing a face that was both familiar and foreign.

“You’re not just a dealer,” they said, voice steady. “You’re a key.”

Sága’s pulse quickened. “I don’t even know what I’ve lost.”

The client stepped forward, their expression unreadable. “You were never meant to forget. The Council took that from you, but it wasn’t the only one. There are others like you. Others who remember.”

A cold dread settled in her stomach. “Who are you?”

“I am an Echoist,” they said simply. “And we believe you have the power to change everything.”

Sága’s hands curled into fists. “I was used. I don’t want to be a part of this.”

The client tilted their head. “You were used, yes. But now you are free to choose. And if you choose to remember, you may be the one who breaks the system.”

She didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she looked around the booth, at the floating orbs and the distant hum of the Exchange. She had spent years trading away pieces of her past, convincing herself that survival was worth it. But now, standing here, she felt something else.

She felt like a ghost.

The Echoist’s words echoed in her mind: *“Some memories cannot be reclaimed without consequence.”*

She didn’t know what the consequences would be, but she knew one thing for certain.

She had nothing left to lose.
