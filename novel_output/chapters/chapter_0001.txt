Jax Xenobia sat hunched over a cluttered desk in the back of The Hourglass Curios, the faint hum of the neon sign above the shop casting an eerie glow through the dust-laden glass. The air smelled of old paper, ozone, and something else—something he couldn’t quite place, like the tang of memory that clung to the edges of his mind. It was late, well past midnight, and the only sound in the shop was the soft ticking of a grandfather clock that had been there since before he could remember. He didn’t know how long it had been since he’d last closed the door, but the weight of the silence pressed on him like a stone.

The shop itself was a relic of time. Filled with artifacts from countless timelines, some of which had never existed in any one version of reality. Jax had spent years curating them, each item a whisper of what had been or could be. He had no idea how many of them were actually real, but he knew they held power—some kind of power that he wasn’t prepared to understand.

His fingers hovered over the worn leather cover of an ancient journal, its pages brittle and yellowed from time and neglect. The ink had faded, but the words were still there, etched into his mind like a scar. He’d written them all down once, years ago, before the fracture. Before the world had changed.

He didn’t want to relive that moment again.

But it seemed he couldn’t escape it.

A flicker in the corner of his vision made him look up. The shop was empty, yet something felt off. He glanced at the clock again—its hands moving backward, then forward. A trick of the light, or maybe just the way the Eddy Reality twisted around itself. He exhaled slowly and returned to the journal, tracing the faded letters with his fingertips.

**Scene 1: The Echo**

He was in a lab, not the one he remembered, but another version of it. The walls were lined with monitors, their screens flickering with data streams that should have been incomprehensible. He had no memory of how he got there, only that he *was* there. A man stood at the center of the room, his face obscured by a helmet, his hands moving over a control panel with precision that felt alien to Jax.

Then the man turned.

Jax’s breath caught in his throat.

It was him—him, in a different time, different place. The same eyes, the same scar across his brow, the same haunted expression. But this version of himself wasn’t alone. A woman stood beside him, her arms crossed, her gaze sharp and knowing. She looked familiar, though Jax couldn’t place her.

“Jax,” she said, voice like a blade through glass. “You were supposed to stop it.”

He didn’t answer. He couldn’t. His hands trembled as he reached for the control panel, but his fingers passed through it like mist. The man—*himself*—was trying to override something, some system that pulsed with an ominous red glow. The monitors around them began to flash erratically, and the air grew heavy with static.

“Do you remember what happened?” the woman asked, stepping closer. “You didn’t mean for it to happen.”

He wanted to say yes, but his voice came out hollow. “I don’t remember.”

She looked at him like he was a ghost, or maybe like he was someone else entirely. “You were meant to be here, but not like this.”

The words echoed in his mind, not just from her mouth, but from somewhere deeper—like they had been whispered into the fabric of time itself. He felt the weight of it settle over him, pressing down on his chest like a vice.

Then, without warning, the lab exploded.

He didn’t feel the explosion. Instead, he was flung back through time, through space, through something that wasn’t quite time or space. His vision blurred, and for a moment, he saw himself again—this time, in the aftermath of the blast. The woman was gone, replaced by chaos. Smoke and fire, screams, the sound of metal tearing apart.

He remembered now.

Or at least, he *thought* he did.

It had been a mission to secure a temporal anchor in the past. A device that could stabilize a timeline before it unraveled. But something had gone wrong. He hadn’t meant for it to happen—hadn’t meant for the anchor to fail, hadn’t meant for the timeline to fracture and for countless realities to collapse into one another. The Great Timeline Fracture. That was what they called it.

He had tried to stop it, but he hadn’t been able to.

And now, years later, the echoes of that moment were coming back to haunt him.

Jax pulled himself from the memory, his hands shaking as he slammed the journal shut. He looked around the shop, the glow of the neon sign casting long shadows across the floor. The walls still shimmered faintly, though it was hard to tell if it was just the light or something more. He had always thought that Eddy Realities were safe—slow, stable, untouched by the chaos of time. But maybe they weren’t.

Maybe they were just hiding places for things that *shouldn’t* be there.

He stood, stretching his aching back, and reached for a glass of whiskey he hadn’t noticed was on the desk. It felt warm in his hand, like it had been sitting there for hours. He took a sip, letting the burn ease the tension in his chest.

“I didn’t mean for that to happen,” he muttered, more to himself than anyone else. “I didn’t mean for it to get out of control.”

The words felt like a confession, but he didn’t know to whom. The shop was quiet, and the only thing that responded was the ghost of his past.

He had spent years trying to forget. To bury the guilt beneath layers of routine and isolation. But now, the echoes were back, stronger than ever. They came in waves—memories of what *could* have been, of what *should* have been, of what *wasn’t*. And each time, they pulled him deeper into the wreckage.

Jax had always believed that time was a river, flowing in one direction, immutable and unchanging. But now, he wasn’t sure. The more he tried to ignore it, the more it seemed to be trying to remind him of something he’d rather not remember.

He looked at his watch. It read 12:03 AM. He had been here for hours. Maybe longer. The shop was supposed to be a sanctuary, but tonight, it felt like a prison.

A noise behind him made him turn sharply. The door to the shop creaked open, and the faint scent of cinnamon and something metallic entered the air. Jax’s hand went to the pocket of his coat, where he kept the small, silver device he had found years ago—a relic from an unknown timeline that could detect temporal anomalies.

He didn’t move. He didn’t speak. The figure stepped into the light, and for a moment, he thought he was seeing a ghost.

But it wasn’t a ghost.

It was someone real.

The Fixer.

They stood in the doorway, their silhouette shifting slightly as if they were made of smoke and shadow. Their clothes were dark, unmarked, and their face was obscured by a hood. But Jax could feel their presence—the way the air around them seemed to ripple, the way the shop’s reality wavered just for a second.

“I didn’t mean for that to happen,” Jax said again, his voice barely above a whisper.

The Fixer tilted their head slightly, as if considering his words. Jax’s fingers tightened around the whiskey glass, his breath coming in short, uneven bursts. The memory of the lab, the explosion, the woman—those images were still there, still sharp, still *real*. But they weren’t just memories. They were a wound that had never fully healed, a fracture in time that still ached with every passing moment. He had spent years trying to bury it, to forget the way his hands had trembled as he watched the anchor fail, the way he had felt the weight of responsibility press down on him like a thousand pounds.

But now, it was back. And it wasn’t just the echo of the past—it was the echo of *himself*, the echo of the man he had become in trying to escape it.

The Fixer’s words echoed in his mind again, but this time they weren’t just spoken. They were *felt*, like a current pulling at his chest, demanding he face what he had tried so hard to deny. “You don’t have to be alone in this.” It wasn’t a suggestion. It was a command, wrapped in the quiet authority of someone who had seen the same thing he had, who understood the same ache in his bones.

Jax looked up, his eyes locking onto the figure in the doorway. The Fixer stood there, still cloaked in darkness, still shifting like a shadow caught between timelines. But now, Jax could feel the weight of their presence more clearly—like they were not just a visitor to this reality, but a part of it, woven into the fabric of time in a way he couldn’t explain.

“You don’t have to be alone,” The Fixer said again, their voice quieter this time, almost like a whisper. “That timeline is unraveling. You have to choose.”

Jax’s throat tightened. “What are you talking about?”

The Fixer didn’t answer immediately. Instead, they stepped forward, the air between them bending, warping, as if reality itself was trying to hold its breath. “You were meant to be here, but not like this.” The words were a reminder, a truth he had long tried to ignore. He had been running from the past, from the guilt, from the knowledge that he had failed someone—someone who had trusted him.

He looked down at the device in his hand, its symbols still pulsing faintly. It was a key, a bridge, a path back to something he had long buried. And now, it was in his hands, waiting for him to open the door.

“I don’t want to know,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “I don’t want to face it.”

The Fixer tilted their head slightly, as if considering his words. “You’ll never be free of it if you don’t.” Their voice was calm, but there was something in it—something that made Jax feel like he was standing on the edge of a cliff, looking down at the abyss.

He didn’t know what to do. He had spent years avoiding the truth, but now, it felt like time was forcing him to confront it. The Fixer’s presence was a reminder that he wasn’t alone in this. That somewhere, somehow, there were others who remembered, who had been through the same fracture, who understood the same pain.

And if they did, then maybe there was a way to fix it—to mend the wound, to restore what had been lost.

Jax looked at the device again, its surface still glowing faintly. He didn’t know what it was, but he knew one thing: this was the beginning of something he had long tried to forget.Jax blinked. “What?”

The Fixer stepped forward, the space between them stretching unnaturally. “That timeline is unraveling. You have to choose.”

“Choose what?” Jax asked, his voice edged with frustration.

“To be a part of the solution,” The Fixer said, their tone calm but firm. “Or to stay buried in your guilt.”

Jax’s hand tightened around the whiskey glass. He didn’t want to hear this. He didn’t want to believe it. But something about the way they spoke—something about the way the shop seemed to hold its breath—made him feel like he was standing on the edge of a precipice.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Jax said, though the words felt hollow even as he said them.

The Fixer didn’t respond immediately. Instead, they reached into their coat and pulled out a small, unassuming object—a device no larger than a matchbox, its surface etched with strange symbols that seemed to shift when he looked at them too long. They held it out to him, palm up, as if offering it like a gift.

“You don’t have to face this alone,” The Fixer said, their voice like a thread pulled taut. “The truth is out there, but it won’t find you if you stay in the shadows.”

Jax hesitated. He had spent years avoiding anything that might bring him closer to the truth, and now, someone was offering him a path back.

But he wasn’t ready.

He took a step back, his voice low. “I don’t want to know.”

The Fixer’s expression didn’t change, but something in their posture shifted—like they were waiting for him to decide. “Then you’ll never be free of it.”

Jax turned away, his fingers brushing the device as if it might burn him. The weight of it was strange, not heavy, but *felt* like a promise.

“I don’t need your help,” he said, more to himself than to The Fixer.

The Fixer smiled, though it wasn’t a smile in the way Jax expected. It was something else entirely—something that made him feel like time itself was watching.

“You’ll need it anyway.”

And with that, they vanished, leaving behind only the faintest shimmer of light and the lingering scent of cinnamon and ozone.

Jax stood there for a long moment, his heart pounding in his chest. He had spent so long running from this, from the memories, from the guilt, from the truth. But now, it felt like time was forcing him to confront it.

He looked down at the device in his hand, its surface still glowing faintly. He didn’t know what it was, but he knew one thing—this was the beginning of something he had long tried to forget. The echoes weren’t just memories; they were fractures in time, splinters of a wound he’d buried beneath years of silence. The lab, the explosion, the woman’s eyes—those fragments had been etched into his mind by the same force that had shattered the timeline. The device in his hand, once a relic of an unknown past, now pulsed with the same energy that had torn through the fabric of reality, its symbols shifting to match the jagged edges of the echo. The Fixer’s words lingered in his mind like a ghost, but Jax could feel the truth in them: the fracture wasn’t just an event—it was a mirror, reflecting the choices he’d made, the guilt he’d carried, and the part of himself that had been rewritten by time’s cruel hand. He had spent years avoiding the weight of it all, but now, the echoes were no longer whispers of what *could* have been—they were screams of what *was*.**Scene 2: The Arrival**

The shop seemed to hold its breath as Jax stood frozen, staring at the device. It wasn’t just a tool—it was a key. A key to something he didn’t want to open.

He closed his eyes, trying to steady himself. The memory of the lab, the explosion, the woman who had looked at him like he was already lost—those images were still fresh in his mind, though they had been buried for years. He didn’t know if The Fixer had seen them or just sensed something about him.

When he opened his eyes again, the shop was still there, but the air felt different. It wasn’t just the scent of old paper and ozone anymore—it was layered with something else, something *charged*. Like the walls themselves were holding their breath, waiting for him to make a choice.

He reached for the device, his fingers brushing over the symbols. They pulsed faintly, like they were alive. He felt a strange pull in his chest, as if the device were trying to reach into him, to remember something he had forgotten.

“I didn’t mean for that to happen,” he whispered again, this time almost as if he were talking to himself.

The Fixer’s voice came from nowhere and everywhere at once. “You’re not the only one who remembers.”

Jax turned sharply, but the shop was empty. The only sound was the tick of the clock, now moving in a different rhythm, like it had been recalibrated.

He exhaled, rubbing his temples. “I need to remember... I need to fix it.”

The words were barely out of his mouth before the device in his hand began to glow more intensely, its symbols shifting and rearranging as if responding to his thoughts. The shop around him seemed to shimmer, the walls bending slightly, the floor tilting like a ship on a stormy sea.

He looked down at the device again, his pulse quickening. It was as if it had been waiting for this moment—waiting for him to finally acknowledge what he had done.

Jax felt something stir inside him, deep and ancient, like a memory that had been locked away for too long. He didn’t know what it was, but he knew he couldn’t ignore it anymore.

He reached for the device, holding it tightly in his palm as if it might anchor him to reality.

**Scene 3: The Conversation**

Jax’s mind was a storm of conflicting thoughts and emotions. He had spent so long trying to forget, to bury the pain beneath layers of routine and solitude. But now, something was changing. Something inside him was awakening, like a dormant part of his soul that had been waiting for a signal.

The Fixer reappeared in the doorway, their form flickering between presence and absence, as if they were made of time itself. “You were meant to be here,” they said, their voice low and steady. “But not like this.”

Jax frowned, stepping forward. “What are you talking about?”

The Fixer didn’t answer immediately. Instead, they reached out, their fingers brushing against the device in Jax’s hand. It pulsed once more, brighter than before.

“The fracture isn’t just in the past,” The Fixer said finally. “It’s in you.”

Jax felt a chill run down his spine. He had heard that phrase before—something about the way time had *changed* him, not just the events he had witnessed. But he hadn’t believed it. Or maybe he had, and had chosen to ignore it.

“You think I can fix it?” Jax asked, his voice tight with disbelief.

The Fixer’s expression was unreadable. “I think you have to try.”

Jax shook his head. “I don’t want to try.”

“Then you’ll never be free of it,” The Fixer said again, the same words as before. “You can’t outrun time, Jax. You can only *face* it.”

He wanted to argue, to tell them he wasn’t ready, that he had no idea what they were talking about. But something in their tone—something in the way the shop seemed to hold its breath—made him pause.

“I don’t know who you are,” Jax said finally. “Or why you’re here.”

The Fixer tilted their head again. “I’m here because I know what you’ve done. And I know what you’re capable of.”

Jax’s eyes narrowed. “What do you mean by that?”

The Fixer stepped closer, the air between them thick with something unspoken. “You don’t just see echoes, Jax. You *feel* them. You *remember* them. And those memories are more than just fragments—they’re *threads* in a tapestry that’s unraveling.”

Jax felt a sharp pang of guilt. He had always thought he was just an observer, a man who had been caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. But if The Fixer was right, then he had been something more.

A part of him wanted to believe it. A part of him wanted to run.

But the device in his hand still pulsed, and the shop around him felt like it was holding its breath, waiting for him to make a choice.

“I don’t want to be part of this,” Jax said, his voice barely above a whisper. “I just want to forget.”

The Fixer’s eyes met his, and for a moment, Jax thought he saw something in their gaze—something that wasn’t just curiosity or concern, but *understanding*.

“You can’t forget,” they said softly. “Because the truth is already inside you. You just have to let it out.”

Jax felt a strange sense of weight settle on his shoulders. It wasn’t just the device in his hand—it was the enormity of what he had done, and what he might be forced to do again.

He looked at the shop, its walls still shimmering with residual energy. He had always thought it was safe, that it was a place where time couldn’t reach him. But now, he wasn’t so sure.

“I need to remember,” he said at last, his voice steady. “I need to fix it.”

The Fixer nodded slowly. “Then you’ll have to come with me.”

Jax hesitated. “Where?”

“To the Fracture Zone,” The Fixer said. “That’s where the truth lies. And that’s where you’ll find the answers you’re looking for.”

Jax felt a surge of fear and something else—something like hope. He had spent years avoiding this, but now, it felt like he had no choice.

“I don’t know if I can do this,” he admitted, his voice quiet.

The Fixer smiled again, though it was more like a shadow passing over their face. “You already have.”

And with that, they stepped back into the shadows, leaving Jax alone in the shop once more.

But something had changed.

**Scene 4: The Departure**

Jax stared at the device in his hand, its glow steady now, no longer flickering like a dying star. He felt the weight of it in his palm, as if it were holding onto him, reminding him that he wasn’t just a man who had lost his way—he was a part of something much larger.

He looked around the shop again, taking in the details. The dusty shelves, the flickering neon signs, the scent of old paper and ozone. It was all familiar, yet somehow different now. Like the place had changed, or maybe he had.

He reached for the door, his fingers brushing against the wood as if it might dissolve beneath his touch. But it held firm, its surface cool and solid. He stepped out into the alleyway, the air thick with something that felt like time itself.

The Fixer was waiting for him, their form flickering again, but this time, more clearly. “You have to decide,” they said. “If you want to be a part of the solution or stay buried in your guilt.”

Jax looked at them, his mind racing. He had spent so long trying to forget that moment, to bury it beneath layers of routine and solitude. But now, he wasn’t sure if he could.

“I need to remember,” he said again, more firmly this time. “I need to fix it.”

The Fixer nodded. “Then you’ll have to come with me.”

Jax hesitated for a moment, then stepped forward. The alleyway around them seemed to shift, the walls bending and stretching like they were made of glass. He felt the pull of the device in his hand, as if it were guiding him, leading him toward something he couldn’t yet see.

The Fixer turned slightly, their voice low. “The truth is out there, Jax. But it won’t find you if you stay in the shadows.”

Jax looked up at them, his eyes searching for something—something he didn’t know how to name. “I’m not afraid of the truth,” he said finally.

The Fixer smiled again, and for a moment, Jax thought they were human. But then the smile faded, replaced by something else—something that made his stomach twist with unease.

“Then you’ll have to face it,” The Fixer said. “And when you do, you’ll never be the same.”

With those words, they stepped back into the shadows, their form dissolving like smoke in the wind. Jax stood there for a long moment, the device still glowing in his hand.

He looked at the alleyway, its edges blurred by the shifting reality. The air around him felt charged, as if he were standing on the precipice of something vast and unknowable.

He had no idea where the Fixer had gone, but he knew one thing—he couldn’t stay here forever.

The device in his hand pulsed once more, and with it, a new path opened before him.

Jax took a deep breath, then stepped forward into the unknown.

**Scene 5: The Fracture**

As Jax stepped out of the alleyway, the world around him shifted. The air felt heavier, the light dimmer. He wasn’t sure if he was moving forward or backward in time, but the sensation was the same—like he was being pulled through something vast and invisible.

The Fixer’s voice echoed in his mind, steady and unshakable. “You’re not just seeing echoes, Jax. You’re *feeling* them. And they’re growing stronger.”

He looked around, trying to orient himself. The street he had been on was gone, replaced by something else—something that felt like a crossroads of time itself. Buildings flickered in and out of existence, their facades shifting between different eras. A car from the 1950s passed by, followed by a hovercraft from the 22nd century. The sky above was a swirling mass of colors, as if time had been spliced into something unnatural.

He didn’t know where he was, but he knew one thing—this was the Fracture Zone.

The Fixer reappeared beside him, their form flickering between presence and absence. “This is where your past meets your future,” they said. “Where the echoes are strongest.”

Jax felt a strange pull in his chest, like something inside him was being pulled toward the center of this place. He looked down at the device again, its glow steady now, almost *alive*.

“The fracture isn’t just in the past,” The Fixer said. “It’s in you. And it’s growing.”

Jax frowned. “What do you mean?”

The Fixer’s gaze was steady, unyielding. “You were meant to be here, Jax. But not like this. You have a choice—stay in the shadows and let time consume you, or step into the light and face what you’ve done.”

Jax felt his pulse quicken. He had spent so long trying to forget, to escape the guilt of the Great Timeline Fracture. But now, it felt like he was being forced to confront it again.

“I don’t know if I can do this,” he said, voice barely above a whisper.

The Fixer tilted their head again, the same unreadable expression. “You already have.”

Jax looked at them, his mind racing. He had spent years avoiding this, but now, the echoes were louder, clearer, and more insistent. They weren’t just memories—they were *warnings*.

He took a deep breath, then stepped forward.

**Scene 6: The Echoes**

As he moved through the Fracture Zone, Jax felt the weight of time pressing down on him. The device in his hand pulsed with each step, guiding him toward something—something he couldn’t yet see.

The air around him shimmered, and for a moment, he saw himself again.

This time, it wasn’t the lab. It was a different scene—one that felt more real than any memory he had of the past. He stood in the middle of a city, its skyline twisted between different eras. One moment, it looked like 1920s New York, the next, it was a futuristic metropolis with floating cars and holographic billboards.

He saw himself walking down the street, his coat flapping in the wind, his eyes scanning the crowd. His hands were empty, but he could feel the weight of the device in his pocket.

Then, a voice called out to him.

“Jax!”

He turned, and for a moment, he thought he saw her—Lila. She was standing at the edge of the street, her expression unreadable. But then, she was gone, replaced by another version of himself, one with a different face, a different scar, a different past.

The echoes were everywhere now, not just in his mind but in the very fabric of the Fracture Zone. They weren’t just memories—they were *possibilities*, *alternatives*, *fragments of what could have been*.

He felt something stir inside him, deep and ancient, like a part of himself that had been waiting for this moment.

“I didn’t mean for that to happen,” he whispered again, more to himself than anyone else.

The Fixer’s voice came through the haze. As he moved through the Fracture Zone, Jax felt the weight of time pressing down on him—not just the physical strain of being in a place where reality twisted and turned, but the deeper, more insidious burden of his own existence. The echoes were no longer just fragments of memory; they were reflections of who he was, of what he had become, and of the choices that had led him here. He saw himself in different versions of the past, each one a mirror to his guilt, each one a reminder of the path he had taken that had fractured the timeline.

In one echo, he was standing in the lab, the same one he had once left behind, but this time, he was not the man who had fled. He was the man who had made the decision, the man who had known the truth and failed to act. The echoes were not just warnings—they were *confrontations*, each one a piece of himself that had been buried, forgotten, and now forced to rise.

He saw his face in the reflections, but it wasn’t his. It was someone else’s—someone who had lived a different life, made different choices, and perhaps, avoided the guilt altogether. He saw the scar on his face, but it was not his. It was a different scar, one that told a different story, one that didn’t involve the Great Timeline Fracture.

The Fixer’s voice came through the haze again. “You can’t change the past, Jax. But you can *understand* it. And that’s the first step.”

Jax looked at the device in his hand, its glow steady now, almost *alive*. He had spent years trying to escape the memories of that day, trying to convince himself that he was just a man who had made a mistake and moved on. But now, standing in the heart of the Fracture Zone, he realized that the past wasn’t something to be forgotten—it was something to be *faced*. And the echoes were not just echoes of what had been; they were echoes of what could have been, of what he might have done if he had chosen differently.

The device pulsed in his hand, and for the first time, he felt it as more than a tool. It was a bridge, a path, a way to see the truth that had always been there, waiting for him to remember. The echoes were not just memories—they were *possibilities*, *alternatives*, *fragments of what could have been*. And they were demanding that he choose. But you can *understand* it. And that’s the first step.”

Jax looked at the device in his hand, its glow steady now. He had spent so long trying to forget, but now, he realized—there was no way to escape what had been done.

The echoes were a part of him now, and they would not let him go.

**Scene 7: The Truth**

Jax’s mind was a storm of conflicting emotions. He had always believed that time was a river, flowing in one direction, immutable and unchanging. But now, he wasn’t sure. The Fracture Zone was a place where time didn’t flow—it *fractured*, and each fracture held a piece of what could have been.

He looked at the device again, its glow pulsing in rhythm with his thoughts. “What is this thing?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

The Fixer stepped closer, their form flickering like a candle in the wind. “It’s a way to see the echoes more clearly. But it also opens you up to something else—something that has been waiting for you.”

Jax frowned. “What?”

“The fracture,” The Fixer said. “And the truth behind it.”

He felt a chill run down his spine. He had spent so long trying to forget, but now, he realized that the truth was *inside* him. And it would not let him go.

“I need to remember,” he said again, more firmly this time.

The Fixer nodded. “Then you’ll have to face it.”

Jax looked at them, his mind racing. He had spent years running from this, but now, the echoes were louder, clearer, and more insistent.

He took a deep breath, then stepped forward into the unknown.

**Scene 8: The Choice**

As Jax moved deeper into the Fracture Zone, the air around him thickened with tension. He could feel the weight of time pressing down on him, like he was standing on the edge of something vast and unknowable.

The Fixer’s voice came through the haze again. “You have to decide, Jax. If you want to be a part of the solution or stay buried in your guilt.”

Jax felt his pulse quicken. He had spent so long trying to forget, to escape the memories of the Great Timeline Fracture. But now, he realized that he couldn’t.

The echoes were everywhere now, not just in his mind but in the very fabric of the Fracture Zone. They weren’t just memories—they were *possibilities*, *alternatives*, *fragments of what could have been*.

He looked at the device again, its glow steady and unyielding. It was a key to something he had long tried to forget, but now, it felt like he had no choice.

“I need to remember,” he said again, his voice firm.

The Fixer nodded. “Then you’ll have to face it.”

Jax felt something stir inside him, deep and ancient, like a part of himself that had been waiting for this moment.

He took a deep breath, then stepped forward into the unknown.

**Scene 9: The Weight**

As Jax moved through the Fracture Zone, he felt the weight of time pressing down on him. It wasn’t just the echoes—it was something deeper, something more personal. He could feel it in his bones, in his blood, in the very fabric of his being.

The Fixer’s voice came through the haze again. “You were meant to be here, Jax. But not like this.”

He looked at them, his mind racing. He had spent so long trying to escape the memories of the Great Timeline Fracture, but now, he realized that he couldn’t.

The echoes were everywhere now, not just in his mind but in the very fabric of the Fracture Zone. They weren’t just memories—they were *possibilities*, *alternatives*, *fragments of what could have been*.

He looked at the device again, its glow steady and unyielding. It was a key to something he had long tried to forget, but now, it felt like he had no choice.

“I need to remember,” he said again, his voice firm.

The Fixer nodded. “Then you’ll have to face it.”

Jax felt something stir inside him, deep and ancient, like a part of himself that had been waiting for this moment.

He took a deep breath, then stepped forward into the unknown.

**Scene 10: The Revelation**

Jax’s mind was a storm of conflicting emotions. He had spent so long trying to forget, to escape the memories of the Great Timeline Fracture. But now, he realized that he couldn’t.

The echoes were everywhere now, not just in his mind but in the very fabric of the Fracture Zone. They weren’t just memories—they were *possibilities*, *alternatives*, *fragments of what could have been*.

Jax felt something stir inside him, deep and ancient, like a part of himself that had been waiting for this moment.
