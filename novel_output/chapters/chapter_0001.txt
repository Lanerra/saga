Sága awoke to the scent of rust and damp stone, the air thick with the metallic tang of decay. Their body was heavy, like lead had been poured into their bones during sleep. The cot beneath them creaked as if in protest, and the single bulb overhead flickered erratically, casting jagged shadows on the cracked concrete walls. A thin layer of dust coated everything, even the air itself seemed to settle in layers, as though time had stopped just outside the cell.

They sat up slowly, rubbing their temples, trying to shake off the remnants of the nightmare that had clung to them like smoke. In it, they had seen the Grid—those glowing veins of energy that pulsed through the Citadel and beyond—fracturing in a cascade of light and shadow. The great spire above the city, the Obsidian Spire, had collapsed into itself, as if consumed by its own power. People were screaming. The sky was black, not with night, but with something deeper, something wrong.

The dream had felt too real, too close to the truth Sága couldn’t name. They leaned against the cold wall, breathing in the stale air, their fingers brushing over the rough surface of the cot. It wasn’t just exhaustion that weighed on them—it was the memory of the screams, the fear that had been building for weeks now, whispering in the back of their mind like a warning they couldn’t ignore.

"That dream... it's not just a dream."

The words came unbidden, echoing in their own ears. They clenched their fists, nails digging into their palms. The Grid was more than just a system of power; it was the lifeblood of the Citadel, the force that kept the city from descending into chaos. Without it, the lights would go out. The machines would stop. The Enforcers would lose their strength. And the people—those like Sága, forced to work in the name of survival—would be left in darkness.

But what if the Grid was failing? What if the power that kept the world from falling apart was already slipping through their fingers?

The thought sent a shiver down their spine. They had never spoken of the dream to anyone. It was dangerous to think such things, to question the very thing that kept them alive. The Dominion didn’t tolerate doubt. Not in the laborers. Not in the Enforcers. Not even in the Citadel itself.

A distant clang echoed through the tunnels outside their cell, followed by the low rumble of machinery and the occasional scream—sharp, broken, like someone had been cut loose from the world. The sounds were a constant reminder that they were not alone here, that this place was a hive of suffering and toil. Sága wrapped their arms around themselves, trying to hold in the fear that threatened to spill over.

They had seen the Grid before. Not with their eyes, but through the work they did. As a laborer on the Ashen Docks, they were expected to maintain the conduits that fed the city with its unstable energy. The job was dangerous, the work never-ending, and the punishment for failure swift. The Grid was everything. It powered the lights in the Citadel, the machines that kept the city running, even the Enforcers’ weapons. But it was also something more—something ancient, something alive.

The nightmare had shown them that. They could still feel the heat of the collapsing spire, the way the light had twisted and turned, like a living thing in agony. It wasn’t just failing. It was dying.

Sága forced themselves to stand, their legs unsteady beneath them. The cell was narrow, barely more than a space for sleep and excretion, but they moved with purpose now, as if trying to shake the dream from their skin. They reached for the small notebook they kept hidden beneath their cot, its pages filled with sketches and notes from the past weeks—symbols that had appeared in the dream, strange patterns of light and shadow that didn’t match any language they had ever known.

They hadn’t shared those sketches with anyone. Not even Jorin, who sometimes sat beside them during the night, muttering half-remembered tales of a world before the Sundering. Sága had always found his stories too wild, too dangerous to entertain. But now, as they traced the symbols in their notebook with a trembling hand, they wondered if he had been right all along.

The Grid was failing faster than they anticipated.

Sága’s hands shook as they recalled the words from earlier that day. It had been just after lunch, when they had been assigned to clean out the debris from a collapsed section of the docks. The Enforcers—Kael and Veyra—had stood nearby, arguing in hushed tones as if they didn’t want anyone to hear. But Sága had been close enough to catch every syllable.

“...failing faster than we anticipated,” Kael had muttered, his eyes flicking toward the workers below, as if expecting them to understand what he was saying. Veyra had responded sharply, her voice clipped and cold. “They’ll never find the right source of power to stabilize it.”

The words had haunted Sága all day. The Grid wasn’t just failing—it was being fought over. There were those who knew something was wrong, and yet they weren’t looking for a solution. They were searching for a new power source, something that would keep the system running.

But where could that be? And why hadn’t anyone told them?

The thought of it sent a wave of nausea through Sága’s gut. They had spent their life in servitude, scraping by on scraps and the hope that one day they might escape. But now, with every passing moment, that hope felt more fragile than ever. The Grid was the only thing keeping the Citadel from falling. If it failed, what would be left?

Sága stepped out of their cell, the damp air biting at their skin as they moved through the narrow corridors of the labor camp. The walls were slick with condensation, and the floor was uneven, littered with broken tools and discarded rags. They could hear the distant hum of machinery, the rhythmic pounding of hammers, the occasional shout of a supervisor barking orders.

They reached the docks, where the sun barely touched the ground, filtered through a haze of smoke and ash that hung over the city like a shroud. The Ashen Docks were a place of constant motion, though what was being moved was more often than not just the bodies of those who had failed to keep up with the pace.

Sága worked in silence, as was expected. Their task was to clear the debris from the last collapse, which had left a jagged hole in the dockside platform. The conduit that ran beneath it had been damaged, and the workers were sent in without hesitation, their hands bleeding from the sharp edges of broken metal.

As they worked, Sága’s mind drifted back to the conversation between Kael and Veyra. It wasn’t just speculation. It was a truth buried beneath years of lies. They had always believed that the Grid was eternal, that it would never fail because the Citadel needed it to be so. But what if it wasn’t?

Their thoughts were interrupted by a sudden crash nearby. A group of laborers stumbled over one another as they dropped a heavy crate, and for a moment, Sága saw the expressions on their faces—fear, exhaustion, resignation. It was the same look they had seen in so many others, but now it felt different. No longer just the fear of being beaten or executed. Now it was the fear of something deeper, something that none of them could name.

They looked up at the overhead lights, which flickered like dying stars. The Grid’s pulse was weaker here than it had been before. Sága had always thought it was just a side effect of the decay around them, but now they weren’t so sure.

The dream wasn’t just a nightmare.

It was a warning.

Back in their cell, the bulb above flickered more violently now, casting long shadows across the floor. Sága sat on the cot again, this time with the notebook in their lap. They flipped through the pages, tracing each symbol with their finger, trying to understand what they meant.

The symbols were unlike anything they had ever seen. Some resembled the runes that adorned the conduits, but others were more abstract, like waves or spirals of energy. Their mind raced with possibilities. Could it be a language? A code? A message from something—or someone—beyond their comprehension?

"If I can translate this," Sága murmured to themselves, "maybe I can understand what’s coming."

They had always been curious, even as a child. Before the labor camp, before the chains of servitude, they had lived in the outskirts of the Citadel, where the old stories were whispered between the cracks of broken walls. Their mother had told them tales of the Sundering, of the war that had shattered the world and given rise to the Dominion. She had spoken of the Last Magus, of the Pact of Silence, of a time when magic and technology had coexisted in harmony.

But those stories had been forbidden. The Council didn’t want people remembering what had happened before. They didn’t want them to know that the Grid wasn’t just a gift—it was a prison built on blood.

Now, as Sága stared at the symbols, they felt the weight of those old stories pressing down on them again. They weren’t sure if they were real or just myths passed down through generations, but something in the nightmare had felt too precise to be imagined. Too real.

And still, the symbols didn’t make sense.

They reached for a pencil and began sketching again, their mind working through every shape and line. The more they drew, the more they felt as if the symbols were watching them back. It was an irrational thought, but one that gripped them with an almost physical tension.

Doubt crept in like a slow poison. What if they were chasing something that didn’t exist? What if the Grid wasn’t failing at all, and their dreams were just the result of too much sleep on the cold floor?

But then they remembered the scream from earlier, the way it had cut through the air like a blade. They remembered the Enforcers’ hushed conversation, the fear in their voices.

And they remembered that the Grid wasn’t failing. It was being drained.

Sága’s hand trembled as they set down the pencil. The thought chilled them more than the cold of the cell ever could.

They had to know the truth.

The next day, Sága found themselves at the communal area, where the laborers took their breaks between shifts. They sat on a rusted bench near the edge of the room, watching as others passed by—heads down, eyes avoiding contact. The place was always quiet, save for the occasional mutter of exhaustion or the sharp reprimand of a supervisor. But today, the silence felt heavier.

Jorin approached them with his usual wary glance, his face lined from years of labor and too much smoke. He sat beside Sága without asking, as if he had always known they would be here. "You’ve been drawing again," he said after a moment, his voice low.

Sága hesitated before pulling the notebook from their satchel and sliding it across the bench. "I thought I saw something in the dream."

Jorin looked at the pages, his eyes narrowing as they scanned the symbols. He didn’t say anything at first, just stared at them with an intensity that made Sága uneasy.

"You’re playing with fire, Sága," he finally said. "The Grid isn’t something you can fix."

Sága bristled at the words. "Why not? It’s failing. I’ve seen it. I’ve heard it."

Jorin exhaled sharply, shaking his head. “You don’t know what you’re asking. The Grid is more than just power. It’s control. And those who try to change that... they disappear.”

The words hung in the air between them, thick and unspoken. Sága wanted to argue, to push back against the fear that had always been in Jorin’s voice. But they knew better than to challenge him directly. He had seen things no one else had.

Still, something in his tone made Sága wonder. “You’ve seen it too, haven’t you?” They asked, their voice quiet but firm.

Jorin didn’t look at them. "I’ve seen more than that."

The conversation ended there, but the unease between them lingered. Later that evening, when they were both in the kitchen for dinner, Jorin approached again, this time with a new urgency.

“I didn’t mean to scare you,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “But I know what’s happening. The Grid is failing because of something deeper than we can see.”

Sága looked up from their bowl of thin gruel, the taste of it already making them sick. “What are you saying?”

Jorin hesitated, then leaned in. “They’re using people as fuel. That’s why it’s failing now. They can’t keep drawing from us forever. And when they run out... I don’t think we’ll be the ones left standing.”

The words sent a jolt through Sága’s chest. It wasn’t just a theory. It was an accusation, a truth that had been buried for so long it felt like a ghost trying to break free.

They wanted to believe him, but the weight of what he said pressed against their thoughts. If they were right, then everything Sága had ever known—the Citadel, the Grid, even the Enforcers—was built on something monstrous.

But they also knew that Jorin was not the kind of man who would speak without knowing. He had been exiled once, long ago, for reasons he never fully explained. And now, for some reason, he was here again, watching them like a wolf waiting to see if they would run.

Sága’s hands trembled as they reached for their notebook again, but Jorin caught them before they could hide it away. “You’re not going to stop now, are you?” he asked.

They met his eyes, and for the first time, Sága didn’t look away. “No,” they said quietly. “I want to know the truth.”

And so, with Jorin’s reluctant nod, they began to plan.

Their next assignment came quickly—repairing a conduit in the lower levels of the docks. Supervisor Tarnis assigned them without ceremony, his voice sharp and demanding. “You’ll be working alone today. Do your job, and don’t make mistakes.”

Sága nodded, their stomach twisting at the thought of being left to work in silence. The maintenance tunnel was even worse than the rest of the docks—cold, damp, and filled with the stench of rust and decay. Their boots echoed against the stone floor as they descended, the weak lights overhead casting long shadows that seemed to move on their own.

They reached the conduit—a massive structure of metal and glass, pulsing with a faint blue light. But something was wrong. The glow was uneven, flickering in strange patterns that made Sága’s skin crawl. They had seen conduits like this before, but never with such instability.

As they worked, their fingers brushing against the cold surface, they noticed something on the metal—residue, dark and sticky, clinging to the seams like blood. It wasn’t just dirt or grime. It was something else.

And then, as they reached into the conduit, a whisper came through the residue, low and insistent.

*Sága...*

They froze, heart pounding in their chest. The whisper had been real. Or at least, it had felt real. Their hands trembled as they pulled back, staring at the dark substance with growing dread.

They had to be imagining it.

But the fear that gripped them was not imaginary.

After finishing the repair, Sága emerged from the tunnel, their mind still reeling from the whisper. They hadn’t told anyone what they had felt. Not even Jorin. But as they stood in the dim light of the dockside, they couldn’t shake the feeling that something had changed.

Later that night, back in their cell, the dream came again. This time, it was more vivid, more terrifying.

They were standing before the Citadel, its towering spires cracked and bleeding light like wounds on a dead god. Inside, the council chamber was burning, the flames licking at the edges of ancient tomes and crystalline devices that pulsed with energy. They saw faces in the fire—some they knew, others they didn’t—but all of them were screaming.

And then, from the heart of the fire, a voice spoke their name.

*“That was real... wasn’t it?”*

Sága sat up abruptly, gasping for air. The bulb above flickered violently, casting shadows that seemed to move with their thoughts. They pressed their hands against their forehead, trying to make sense of what they had seen.

It wasn’t just a nightmare anymore.

It was a message.

They couldn’t shake the feeling that the Grid was not failing because of time or overuse. It was failing because someone—or something—was trying to stop it. And if the council chamber was in flames, then the truth might be more dangerous than they had ever imagined.

The next morning, Jorin found them at the communal kitchen, still shaken by the vision. He didn’t speak at first, just studied them with a wary glance before finally sitting down across from them.

“I saw it too,” he said quietly. “That vision. It’s not just in your head, Sága. It’s real.”

Sága looked up sharply. “What are you talking about?”

Jorin hesitated, then reached into his coat and pulled out a small, tattered journal. "I used to be with the Free Scribes," he said. "Before I was exiled. I saw what they did. I tried to stop it."

Sága’s breath caught in their throat. “You were one of them?”

Jorin nodded. “I was. And I know what they’re hiding.”

He flipped open the journal, revealing a series of sketches and notes that looked eerily similar to the ones Sága had been drawing. Their heart pounded.

“They used people as fuel,” Jorin continued, his voice low. “The Grid isn’t just powered by magic or machines. It’s powered by lives. By sacrifices made in secret.”

Sága stared at him, their mind racing. “Why would they do that? Why not find another source?”

Jorin’s expression darkened. “Because there is no other source. The Grid was built on the ruins of Vareth. On the people who died in its creation. Every time it draws power, it takes more from us.”

A cold weight settled in Sága’s chest. They had always known that the laborers were expendable, but this... this was something else.

They looked down at their notebook again, the symbols now seeming to pulse with a strange energy. “What are they hiding?”

Jorin’s eyes met theirs, and for the first time, Sága saw something in him that wasn’t just fear. It was determination.

“They’re hiding the truth,” he said. “That the Grid is failing because it’s built on lies. On blood.”

Sága swallowed hard. The dream had been a warning. And now, with Jorin beside them, they felt like they might be close to understanding what it meant.

They didn’t know how they would find the answers, but they knew one thing for certain.

They couldn’t go back to ignorance.

Later that day, they found themselves in the dock archives—an old, forgotten place where only the most desperate or the most curious dared to tread. The room was filled with dust-covered tomes and flickering holographic displays that barely functioned anymore. It was a relic of a time before the Grid had taken over everything.

Jorin led them deeper into the archive, his steps careful as if he were afraid of waking something. He stopped in front of a large, cracked table where a map lay spread out, its edges curling with age.

“This is how they’ve been keeping control,” Jorin said, pointing at the lines that ran from the Citadel to the Hollow Expanse. “They built the Grid on the bones of Vareth. And now, they’re drawing from the same place.”

Sága’s eyes followed his finger, tracing the lines that led out beyond the city, into the forbidden lands. The Hollow Expanse had always been a place of rumors and fear. No one went there unless they were desperate or insane.

“But how do we stop it?” Sága asked, their voice barely above a whisper.

Jorin turned to them, his expression serious. “We don’t,” he said. “Not yet. First, we have to understand what they’ve done. And then... we decide what to do about it.”

Sága stared at the map, their mind already racing with thoughts of what that might mean. They had always believed that the answer would be found within the Citadel’s walls, that the truth was something that could be spoken or written in some official record.

But now, they weren’t so sure.

The night after discovering the map, Sága barely slept. Their dreams were restless, filled with the echoes of screams and the flickering light of a dying world. When they finally did fall into slumber, it was brief and broken, their heart pounding with each new revelation.

They woke to the sound of footsteps outside their cell. A patrol. The Enforcers had come for them.

Sága’s breath caught as they reached for the door, but Jorin was already there, his hand on the handle. “We have to go,” he said, his voice urgent. “Now.”

They slipped out into the tunnels, their hearts pounding in unison. The air was thick with the scent of oil and metal, the walls slick with moisture. They moved quickly, their steps silent against the floor, but they knew it wouldn’t last.

The Enforcers would find them soon.

As they ran, Jorin’s voice cut through the silence. “This isn’t just about the Grid—it’s about what they’ve done to us.”

Sága didn’t know if they had the strength to believe him. But as they reached the edge of the Hollow Expanse, where the land was eerily silent and untouched by time, they felt something shift inside them.

They were no longer just a laborer in the shadows of the Citadel.

They were part of something bigger now.

The threshold was marked only by the absence of sound. The air here was different—thicker, colder, filled with an energy that made the hairs on Sága’s arms stand on end. They had heard stories about the Hollow Expanse, but nothing could have prepared them for the way it felt: as if they were standing at the edge of a wound in the world.

Jorin looked back at them, his expression unreadable. “This place used to be alive,” he said. “Now it’s just... empty.”

Sága swallowed hard. They had always believed that the Hollow Expanse was a wasteland, a place where nothing remained but ruin and silence. But now, standing on its edge, they felt something else—something watching them, waiting.

“If we go in,” Jorin continued, “there’s no turning back.”

Sága didn’t answer immediately. The weight of the decision pressed against their chest like a stone. They had spent their life running from the truth, surviving by ignoring the whispers that came to them in dreams and the strange residue that clung to the Grid.

But now, they were standing at the door to it.

And for the first time, they weren’t afraid.

They stepped forward, into the silence of the Expanse, their resolve hardening with every step. They didn’t know what awaited them beyond those desolate lands, but they knew one thing: the Grid was failing because of something deeper than they had ever imagined.

And they would find out what that was.

Even if it meant facing the ghosts of Vareth itself.

Even if it meant risking everything.

Because now, Sága understood something important. And nothing would stop them from finding the truth.
