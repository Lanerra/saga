Kaelen Voss moved through the maintenance corridor of the Veil Of Drift with a quiet precision, his boots echoing against the metal floor like the distant toll of a funeral bell. The station had been abandoned for years—long enough that even the dust had grown thick and settled into patterns that looked almost intentional. He was alone in this place, save for the hum of old machinery and the flickering lights that seemed to pulse with a rhythm all their own. It wasn’t just the silence that unsettled him; it was the way time here felt like it had paused, or worse, forgotten.

He had been assigned to this station as part of a reassignment from the Scavenger Wars, a decision he hadn’t fought. The Veil Of Drift had once been a hub for interstellar trade and research, but now it was a graveyard of technology and dreams. His job was simple: catalog the remnants of lost human knowledge before they were lost forever. He had spent months sifting through archives that crumbled beneath his fingers, transcribing logs from ships that no longer sailed, and preserving fragments of history that might otherwise be erased by time.

But today, something felt different.

The corridor led to a section he hadn’t accessed in over a year—a sealed data vault buried deep within the station’s core. It had been marked as inactive, its access blocked by outdated security protocols that no longer made sense. He hesitated at the entrance, his gloved hand brushing against the cold metal door. A faint static crackled through the air, like a whisper from somewhere beyond reach.

He pulled out a small interface device from his belt and scanned the lock. The system wasn’t just broken; it was ancient. The kind of code that hadn’t been used since Earth’s systems collapsed in 2147. He frowned, but there was no time to dwell on the implications. His duty was clear, even if the station itself seemed to resist it.

With a few quick keystrokes and a deep breath, he bypassed the lock. The door hissed open, revealing a dimly lit chamber lined with servers that looked like relics from another era. Faded blueprints clung to the walls, their edges curled with age, while holographic displays flickered erratically, casting long shadows across the floor. It was eerie in a way that made his skin crawl—like the station itself was trying to remember something it had long since forgotten.

He stepped inside and activated the main terminal. The screen blinked to life, revealing a cascade of corrupted files. Some were labeled with dates from before the Fall of Earth, others with names he didn’t recognize. His fingers hovered over the keys, and for a moment, he felt like an intruder in a place that had never meant to be found.

Then, as if drawn by some unseen force, his eyes landed on a single file marked **"Operation Skyfall."**

He hadn’t heard of it before. Not in the records he had reviewed, nor in any of the mission logs he had transcribed. A strange name for a mission that had been erased from history—or perhaps it had never existed at all.

Curiosity flared, though it was an unfamiliar emotion for him. He had spent so long avoiding the past, burying himself in the remnants of what once was. But something about this file felt like it belonged to him. As if it were a message meant for his eyes alone.

He opened the file and found only static at first, a jumble of corrupted data that made no sense. Then, slowly, the screen began to clear, revealing fragments of text and images—some of them recognizable, others not. A mission log, incomplete but enough to suggest something had gone terribly wrong. The coordinates were vague, the time stamps inconsistent. But there was one phrase repeated throughout the file: **"The Loop is not what it seems."**

His breath caught.

He had heard that phrase before, in the whispers of the Wastelands, in the echoes that clung to the edges of forgotten ruins. The Keepers Of The Loop spoke of it as a warning, a riddle from an ancient time. But here, in the depths of the Veil Of Drift, it felt like a message from someone who had been lost.

He leaned closer, his fingers tracing the screen’s surface as he tried to make sense of what he was seeing. The mission had vanished during a deep-space exploration in the early 21st century—before the Fall. Before Earth became a shadow in the sky. He couldn’t help but wonder who had been on that mission and why they had left no trace.

A flicker of static caught his attention, and for a moment, he thought he saw movement in the corner of his eye. The lights in the vault dimmed slightly, as if something had stirred. He turned sharply, but the corridor was empty. Just dust and silence.

He shook his head, dismissing the thought. It was just the station’s systems playing tricks on him.

Still, the message lingered in his mind. He had spent years avoiding it, but now it was reaching out to him with answers he didn’t know how to accept.

As he began to sift through the remaining files, hoping to find more clues, a low hum filled the chamber. It was faint at first, like the sound of distant machinery, but then it grew louder—steady, rhythmic, and unsettling. Kaelen’s heart quickened. He had heard that sound before, in the archives of the Lunar Loop Colony Eternity.

He wasn’t sure how he knew that, but it felt like a warning.

The hum was coming from deeper within the vault. As if the station itself were reacting to his presence.

He moved toward the source, his boots making soft clicks against the floor. The air grew heavier, charged with something unseen. Then, without warning, the lights in the vault flickered and died, plunging him into darkness.

For a moment, he was alone.

But then, a voice—soft, distorted, and filled with urgency—echoed through the chamber.

_"Do not look too deep. The Loop is watching."_

Kaelen froze. His fingers tightened around the interface device as his pulse pounded in his ears. He had no idea where the voice had come from, but it felt like it was coming from inside him, or perhaps from the station itself.

He forced himself to move, to press forward. The vault’s systems were failing, and he needed to understand what he had found before it was too late.

The next thing he knew, the lights flickered back on, casting an eerie glow over the terminal. The message was still there, but now it felt different—like it had been waiting for him to return.

He leaned in closer, his breath shallow as he stared at the screen. The words were clearer now, and with them came a sense of something long buried. Something that didn’t just belong to the past, but to the present, and perhaps even the future.

_"We did not vanish. We were taken. The Loop is not safe. It is a trap."_

He stared at the message, his mind racing through the implications. If this was from Operation Skyfall, then they had discovered something about the Lunar Loop that the Keepers had never wanted to be known. And if they had been taken, then what happened to them?

His fingers hovered over the keyboard once more, but this time he wasn’t sure if he was ready. He had spent years avoiding the past, and now it was reaching out to him with answers he didn’t know how to accept.

The hum returned, louder now, almost like a heartbeat. It pulsed through the air, reverberating in his chest. He felt it in his bones, as if the station were trying to tell him something.

He closed his eyes and let the sound wash over him. When he opened them again, the screen had changed—no longer showing the corrupted logs of Operation Skyfall, but a single line of text that read:

**"Project Echo."**

He didn’t know what it meant, but he knew it was important. He reached for the interface device and tried to access deeper layers of the archive. The system resisted at first, then suddenly responded with a surge of data.

The screen flickered again, revealing a set of coordinates—star systems that had long since been lost to time fractures and forgotten by all but the most desperate scavengers. It was a place that didn’t exist on any known map, yet it felt like it should.

He stared at the coordinates, his mind churning with questions. Who had left them? Why? And what did they mean?

Before he could process the full weight of what he had found, a deep tremor ran through the station. It wasn’t just a vibration; it was a warning, like the ground beneath him was shifting. The lights flickered violently, and for a moment, he thought the entire system might collapse.

He scrambled to his feet, heart pounding as alarms blared from unseen speakers. The hum from *The Keeper* grew louder, almost deafening now. He wasn’t sure if it was part of the system or something else entirely.

But then, just as quickly as it had started, the tremor stopped. The lights steadied, and the station fell back into its usual silence—except for the faint crackle of static that filled the air like a promise.

Kaelen knew he wasn’t alone in this place anymore. Something had changed. Something had awakened.

He looked down at the terminal again, his fingers trembling as he reached for the keyboard. He needed to understand what he had found. He needed to know why it had taken so long for him to see it.

And more than anything, he needed to know if it was still too late to stop whatever was coming.

The coordinates were a message. A warning. And perhaps, a key.

He took a deep breath and typed the command that would unlock the final layer of the archive.
