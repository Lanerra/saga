Jax Xenobia sat hunched over his desk in *the_hourglass_curios*, the dim glow of a single lamp casting long shadows across the cluttered room. The air smelled of old paper, dust, and something metallic—like ozone or static, depending on how you looked at it. He had spent years avoiding this place, but now it felt like the only thing left in his life that was real. Or at least, more real than the memories he tried to forget.

The device lay before him, its surface etched with symbols that pulsed faintly under the light. It wasn’t just a relic. Dr. Varen Kael had said so, and Jax, for all his skepticism, had to admit the words carried weight. The artifact was part of something bigger—a network of temporal echoes scattered across history, each one a fragment of the Great Timeline Fracture. He had dismissed it as a myth, but now, with the device in his hands, he felt the pull of something ancient and dangerous.

He traced the symbols with his fingertips, feeling the strange warmth that radiated from them. “You didn’t cause this,” Kael’s voice echoed in his mind, though Jax knew the doctor wasn’t physically there. He had left hours ago, muttering about needing to verify some coordinates. But the words lingered, sharp and undeniable. “You were just a pawn.”

It was a cruel truth, but one that resonated with Jax more than he wanted to admit. He had spent so long believing himself responsible for Lila’s fate, for the fracture that shattered everything he once knew. Now, the weight of that guilt felt less like a burden and more like an illusion.

The device hummed, and the glow intensified. A low vibration filled the room, like a heartbeat from another time. Jax’s eyes widened as the symbols began to shimmer, shifting in patterns he couldn’t quite follow. The air around him seemed to ripple, not physically but in a way that made the walls of his shop feel like they were breathing.

Then, without warning, the world around him dissolved into light.

**Scene 1: The Device’s Inscriptions and the Signal**

Jax found himself standing in an open expanse of shifting light. It was neither day nor night, but something in between—a place that existed outside time. The air was thick with a strange energy, humming like a forgotten radio station. Around him, fragments of reality flickered in and out of focus: a crumbling library, a neon-lit alleyway, a battlefield covered in ash and fire. Each image lasted only a second before vanishing, leaving behind only the sound of something breaking.

He turned, and there stood Dr. Varen Kael, his coat tattered from what looked like a long journey through time and space. His face was lined with age and weariness, but his eyes burned with something that wasn’t quite hope—more like clarity.

“You’ve been chasing ghosts,” Kael said, stepping closer. “But some ghosts are trying to reach you.”

Jax’s mouth was dry. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d spoken to anyone, let alone someone who had once been part of the Temporal Concord. “What is this place?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Kael didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he looked at the device in Jax’s hands. “This isn’t just a relic,” he said. “It’s a key. Jax found himself standing in an open expanse of shifting light.

He had left hours ago, muttering about needing to verify some coordinates. But the words lingered, sharp and undeniable. “You were just a pawn.”

It was a cruel truth, but one that resonated with Jax more than he wanted to admit. He had spent so long believing the fracture was his fault, an accident caused by his own recklessness. But now, with this device, the truth felt like it might finally slip through his fingers.

Kael studied the device in Jax’s hands. “This isn’t just a relic,” he said. “It’s a key. But not a key to unlock your past. It’s a key to a system that’s been built to control time, to keep certain truths hidden.”

Jax’s mind raced. If the fracture wasn’t his fault, then who was responsible? Who had used him? He thought of the countless times he had tried to forget, to bury the guilt deep in his bones. But now, with this device, the truth felt like it might finally slip through his fingers.

He looked down at the device again, its glow steady now, almost welcoming. “So… I wasn’t the cause.”

“No,” Kael said. “But you were part of it. And that’s why you can see these echoes. You’re the only one who can.”Jax frowned. “I don’t understand. What does it mean?”

“It means you’re not alone,” Kael replied, his tone more serious now. “You were never the cause of the fracture. You were just a catalyst. And this device is part of a vast network—one that stretches across time itself.”

A chill ran down Jax’s spine. He had always believed the fracture was a mistake, an accident caused by his own recklessness. But Kael’s words cut through that illusion like a blade.

“What do you mean?” Jax asked, gripping the device tighter.

Kael gestured to the shifting images around them. “These are echoes. Not just memories, but warnings. They show what could have been—what *should* have been. And they’re trying to tell you something about your past.”

Jax’s mind raced. If the fracture wasn’t his fault, then who was responsible? Who had used him? He thought of the countless times he had tried to forget, to bury the guilt deep in his bones. But now, with this device, the truth felt like it might finally slip through his fingers.

Then, without warning, the world around him dissolved into light.

He looked down at the device again, its glow steady now, almost welcoming. “So… I wasn’t the cause,” he said, his voice trembling.

“No,” Kael said. “But you were part of it. And that’s why you can see these echoes. You’re the only one who can.”

Jax wanted to argue, to deny it, but the weight of the words settled in his chest like a stone. He had spent so long blaming himself, believing that every moment since had been shaped by his choices. But maybe—just maybe—that wasn’t the case.

He looked up at Kael, searching for something more. “Then… why did I lose her?”

Kael’s expression darkened. “Because she was never meant to be lost.” “They’re the remnants of altered events. Events that were meant to stay hidden.”

Jax’s breath caught. He had always believed the echoes were a curse, a reminder of what he couldn’t change. But now they felt like something else—something *intentional*. Like they were trying to show him the truth, not just haunt him with it.

He looked up at Kael, searching for something more. “Then… why did I lose her?”

Kael’s expression darkened. “Because she was never meant to be lost.”

The words hit Jax like a punch. He staggered back, his hand gripping the edge of the device. “What are you saying?”

“That the fracture wasn’t an accident,” Kael said. “It was a test. A controlled experiment. And you were the one who could see it.”

Jax’s mind reeled. If that was true, then everything he had believed about his past was wrong. He had spent years trying to find Lila, to understand why she had vanished, but now the idea that she might still be alive in another timeline felt both terrifying and liberating.

He closed his eyes, letting the weight of the moment settle. When he opened them again, the shifting light had faded, and he was back in his shop, the device glowing faintly on his desk.

---

**Scene 2: Echoes of a Different Past**

The room felt different now. The dust hung heavier in the air, the silence more oppressive. Jax’s fingers trembled as he reached for the device again, but this time, he didn’t just touch it—he activated it.

A low hum filled the shop, and the walls began to shift. The floorboards groaned, the ceiling rippled like water, and suddenly, Jax was no longer in *the_hourglass_curios*. He stood in a version of his past that felt both familiar and alien.

It was the day he had first met Lila. The air was colder, the sky darker than it should have been. He saw himself—older, perhaps, but not by much—standing at the edge of a temporal hub, a place he had only ever heard about in rumors. She was there too, her face lit with something he hadn’t seen in years: hope.

“You were supposed to be here,” Jax heard himself say, though it wasn’t his voice. It was the echo of his past self, speaking from somewhere behind him.

Lila turned, her eyes wide. “You’re not supposed to be here either.”

He felt a pang of something—regret, maybe, or confusion. He had always believed he was the one who had failed her, that he had let her die because of his own weakness. But in this echo, it was different. Lila was alive. And he wasn’t the one who had caused the fracture.

The scene shifted again. This time, he saw himself in a different moment—when the fracture had first begun. He was standing in the middle of a storm of light and shadow, surrounded by figures that looked like versions of himself. They were watching him, waiting. One of them, younger and more confident, stepped forward.

“You don’t understand what you’re doing,” the echo said. “You were never meant to see this.”

Jax’s breath caught in his throat. He had always thought he was the only one who could perceive these echoes, but now he realized he wasn’t. There were others—others who had seen the same things, and others who had tried to stop them.

The echo of himself raised a hand, and suddenly, Jax felt the weight of all the choices he had made. He saw himself in other timelines: one where he had failed to protect Lila, another where he had succeeded, and yet another where he had never met her at all. Each version of him was different, shaped by the paths he had taken, but none of them were *his*.

He felt a surge of anger, of betrayal. “You were using me,” he said, his voice barely audible over the hum of the device.

The echo only smiled. “We were trying to save you.”

Jax’s hands clenched into fists. He had spent years believing he was the reason for everything that had gone wrong, but now it felt like he had been manipulated from the start. The fracture wasn’t an accident—it was a test. A test of his will, his ability to resist the forces that sought to control time.

The scene flickered again, and Jax was back in his shop, the device still glowing. He looked around, trying to steady his breathing. The air felt heavier now, charged with something he couldn’t name.

He had seen too much. Too many versions of himself, too many possibilities of Lila’s fate. And yet, none of them were the truth he had clung to for so long.

He closed the device and sat back in his chair, staring at the floor. “I need to find her,” he said quietly. “Not just remember her.”

Kael’s voice echoed in his mind again. “The echoes are a path, not a prison. You have to follow it.”

Jax looked up, his eyes dark with resolve. He had spent so long running from the past, but now he had no choice. If he was a pawn, then he had to find out who had played him. And if Lila was still out there, somewhere in the echoes of time, then he had to find her before it was too late.

---

**Scene 3: The Hidden Map and the First Fracture**

Jax returned to his shop, the device in his hands now feeling like a part of himself. He placed it on the table, its glow steady as if waiting for him to make a decision. He reached into the drawer beneath the desk, pulling out a small, leather-bound journal that had been there since before he opened *the_hourglass_curios*.

He flipped through the pages, searching for anything that might help him. Most of the entries were filled with notes on temporal anomalies, some cryptic and others too vague to understand. But then, on one page, he found something strange—a map, drawn in ink that shimmered faintly as if it were alive.

It was unlike anything he had ever seen. The lines shifted, forming constellations of time rather than space. There were symbols at the edges, some matching the ones on the device. He traced them with his finger, and the map pulsed, sending a jolt through his body.

The shop began to tremble again, the walls vibrating as if something beneath them was stirring. Jax’s heart pounded in his chest, but he didn’t move. He waited, letting the energy build until finally, the floor gave way beneath him.

He tumbled down into darkness, then light. When he landed, he found himself standing in a chamber that felt ancient and new at once. The walls were made of shifting light, like liquid glass, and the air was thick with whispers—voices from different times, from different lives.

In the center of the room stood a pedestal, and on it was a single artifact: a crystalline sphere, pulsing with the same golden glow as the device in his hands. It was older than anything he had ever seen, and its presence made the air feel heavy with meaning.

He stepped closer, drawn by an unseen force. The whispers grew louder, forming words that echoed in his mind. “This place holds the first fracture,” one voice said. “It’s where everything began.”

Jax’s breath caught in his throat. He had always believed the fracture was a mistake, but now he saw it differently. It wasn’t just an accident—it was the beginning of something far greater, and he was at its center.

He reached out, his fingers brushing the sphere’s surface. A rush of images flooded his mind—visions of the past, of people who had tried to stop the fracture, of others who had failed. And then, a single moment stood out: himself, standing before the sphere, his face filled with determination.

He saw his younger self, not the one he had always imagined, but one that was different. This version of him wasn’t broken. He wasn’t haunted by guilt. He was *alive*.

Jax’s chest tightened. “I didn’t know… I was just following orders.”

The whispers swelled, and the chamber began to shift again. The walls melted into new shapes, revealing more of the past. He saw himself in another timeline, standing in a different version of *the_hourglass_curios*, speaking with someone he didn’t recognize.

It was Lila. But she wasn’t the one he remembered. She was younger, stronger, and more alive than he had ever seen her. Her eyes met his, filled with something that wasn’t fear or sorrow—just certainty.

“You were never meant to be the cause,” she said, her voice echoing in his mind. “You were the key.”

Jax’s hands trembled. He had always believed he was the one who had broken time, but now it felt like he had been used for something far more dangerous. The fracture wasn’t just a mistake—it was a test, and he had passed it.

But not in the way he thought.

The chamber began to fade, and Jax was pulled back into the shop, his mind racing with questions. He had spent so long trying to remember Lila, to understand why she had vanished, but now he saw that she had been *there* all along—just in a different timeline.

He looked down at the device again, its glow steady. “The echoes are not lies,” he whispered. “They’re fragments of a truth we were never meant to see.”

He had spent years trying to escape the past, but now it felt like he was finally *inside* it. And that terrified him more than anything else ever had.

---

**Scene 4: The Echo of Himself**

The next time Jax activated the device, it didn’t take him to a new timeline—it took him to a memory of his own.

He stood in a dimly lit room, the walls lined with old books and strange artifacts. A clock ticked in the corner, its hands moving backward. He looked around, and for a moment, he thought he was in *the_hourglass_curios* again. But then he saw himself—older, more weathered, but still standing.

“Jax,” the echo said, his voice carrying an edge of something Jax couldn’t quite place. “You were never meant to be alone.”

Jax stepped forward, his reflection in the glass window distorting as if it weren’t real. “What are you talking about?”

The echo looked up at him, his expression unreadable. “You think you caused the fracture,” he said. “But you didn’t. You were just a tool. Someone used you to unlock its secrets.”

Jax’s stomach twisted. He had always thought of himself as a victim, a man who had made a mistake and paid the price. But now it felt like he had been *manipulated*—used for something greater than himself.

“You were part of an experiment,” the echo continued. “A test to see if you could resist the forces that seek to control time.”

Jax’s mind reeled. He had spent years trying to forget, to deny the truth of his past, but now it felt like he had been *set up* for this. That every choice he had made, every moment he had lived, had been shaped by something beyond his control.

He looked at the echo, searching for answers. “Who did this?”

The echo’s expression darkened. “That’s what you need to find out.”

The room around him began to flicker, and Jax felt a pull, like gravity from another dimension. He tried to reach out, but his hand passed through the echo’s.

“You were their first test,” the echo said, his voice fading. “And now, they’re coming for you again.”

Jax gasped as the image dissolved, leaving him standing in silence. The weight of the revelation pressed down on him like a storm. He had never been the cause of the fracture. He had been *used*.

He stumbled back, his mind racing. If he was a tool, then who had used him? And why?

The device hummed again, its glow intensifying as if it were responding to his thoughts. Jax reached for it, but this time, the light didn’t just flicker—it expanded, filling the room with a golden glow that made everything feel like it was moving in slow motion.

He closed his eyes, trying to steady himself. The echoes had shown him too much, and he wasn’t sure he could handle it all at once. But one thing was clear: he couldn’t run from this anymore.

He opened his eyes and looked at the device, its surface now glowing with a deeper light. “I need to find the truth,” he said, his voice firm. “Not just remember it.”

The shop around him felt different now—charged with energy, like the air itself was holding its breath. He had spent so long trying to escape the past, but now he realized that the only way forward was to face it.

He reached into his pocket and pulled out the disc Dr. Kael had given him. He looked down at the device again, its glow steady. “The echoes are not lies,” he whispered. “They’re fragments of a truth we were never meant to see.” 

He had spent years trying to escape the past, but now it felt like he was finally *inside* it. And that terrified him more than anything else ever had.

He reached into his pocket and pulled out the disc Dr. Kael had given him. It was still warm from his hand, and as he held it up to the light, he noticed something—**the symbols on it matched those on the device in his hands**, just as they had on the ancient artifacts he had studied for years. 

It was no coincidence. The disc had been in his possession for months, but he hadn’t realized until now that it was a piece of the same network. Kael had given it to him not just as a token of trust, but as a key to the same puzzle he was now unraveling. 

The connection was there all along, hidden in the way the disc had felt in his hand, in the way the device had hummed when he first touched it. He had been following a trail that led back to itself, and now he saw the truth: the fracture wasn’t just a mistake—it was a test, and he had been *used* for something far greater. 

The device pulsed again, and Jax felt a pull—like the artifact was trying to show him something else. He stared at the disc, then at the device, his mind racing. The symbols were a bridge, a link between the two artifacts, and now he understood why Kael had given it to him. 

It wasn’t just about finding Lila. It was about finding the *source* of the fracture, the one who had orchestrated it all. And if the disc and the device were connected, then that source was closer than he had ever imagined.The room trembled again, and Jax felt a pull—like the device was trying to show him something else.

He took a deep breath and stepped forward, ready to face whatever came next.

---

**Scene 5: The Truth of the Fracture**

Jax sat in his shop, the device resting on the table. He had spent hours analyzing its inscriptions, cross-referencing them with the disc Kael had given him. The more he studied, the more he realized that the fracture wasn’t just an accident—it was a deliberate act, one that had been orchestrated by someone within the Temporal Concord.

He thought of Dr. Varen Kael, of Professor Sera Lin, and of the others who had tried to uncover the truth. They had all believed he was the cause, but now he saw that they were wrong.

The device pulsed again, and Jax felt a pull—not just from the artifact, but from something deeper. He reached for it, his fingers brushing the surface, and the room around him began to shift.

He was no longer in *the_hourglass_curios*. Instead, he found himself standing in a vast chamber that looked like it had been built from light and shadow. The walls were made of shifting constellations, each one representing a different timeline. In the center stood a pedestal, and on it rested a single artifact: a sphere of pure gold, its surface etched with the same symbols as the device.

He stepped closer, his breath shallow. “This is where it all started,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “The first fracture.”

The sphere pulsed, and suddenly, he was surrounded by voices—his own, Lila’s, Kael’s. They spoke in fragments, their words overlapping like the echoes that had haunted him for years.

“You were never meant to be the cause,” one of them said, echoing the same phrase from before. “You were just a key.”

Jax clenched his fists. He had spent so long believing he was responsible for everything that had gone wrong, but now it felt like he had been *used* for something far greater. The fracture had been a test, and he had passed it.

But the question remained: who had set it up?

He looked around the chamber, its walls shifting with each thought that crossed his mind. He saw himself in different moments—some where he had made mistakes, others where he had succeeded. And in every version, there was Lila.

In one, she stood beside him, her hand in his. In another, she was running away from a storm of light and shadow. In another, she was gone, lost to time. But each time, he saw her—alive, present, and waiting for him.

He felt something shift inside him, not just in understanding but in *resolve*. He had spent years trying to escape the past, to forget the guilt that clung to him like a shadow. But now, with the truth before him, he realized that the only way to move forward was to face it.

He turned back to the sphere, his voice steady. “I need to find her.”

The chamber pulsed again, and the voices grew louder. “She’s still out there,” one of them said. “In a timeline where you didn’t fail her.”

Jax felt a surge of hope—and fear. If Lila was alive in another timeline, then maybe he could change things. Maybe he could finally stop running from his past.

But the question remained: who had *used* him? And why?

He reached out, fingers brushing the sphere’s surface. The moment he touched it, the room around him dissolved into light again, and he was back in his shop, the device still glowing.

For the first time in years, Jax felt something close to peace. Not because he had forgotten, but because he had finally *understood*.

He looked at the device, its surface now humming with a new intensity. It wasn’t just showing him the past—it was leading him somewhere.

Somewhere where the truth waited.

He stood, his eyes dark with determination. “I need to find out who did this,” he said, his voice firm.

And then, for the first time in years, he took a step forward—not to escape, but to face what had been done.

---

**Scene 5 (Continued): The Weight of the Truth**

Jax’s fingers trembled as he placed the device back on the table. He had spent so long trying to forget, to convince himself that he was the one who had broken time. But now, he saw it for what it was: a test, a manipulation, and a betrayal.

He sat down, his back against the wall, staring at the artifact as if it might answer all his questions. The disc from Kael rested beside it, its symbols glowing faintly in the dim light of the shop. He picked it up, turning it over in his hands.

“What do you want from me?” he asked, more to himself than anyone else.

The whispers returned, soft and insistent. “You were never meant to be alone,” they said. “You were part of something greater.”

Jax exhaled slowly, the weight of the revelation pressing down on him like a storm. He had spent years in this shop, trying to escape the memories that haunted him. But now, he realized that those memories weren’t just a burden—they were a map.

He looked at the device again, its glow steady. “If I can see these echoes,” he murmured, “then maybe I can find her. Maybe I can find the truth.”

The air in the shop felt different now—thicker, more charged. Jax stood, his mind racing with possibilities. If the fracture had been a test, then there were others like it. Others who had tried to change history, who had failed or succeeded.

He thought of Dr. Varen Kael, of Professor Sera Lin, and of the other agents who had worked in the shadows to uncover the truth. They had all believed he was the cause, but now he saw that they had been *wrong*.

And that realization made him feel something close to hope.

He picked up the device, feeling its warmth in his palm. “I need to find out who did this,” he said, his voice firm. “Who used me.”

The shop around him seemed to pulse with energy, as if it were listening. He looked at the map on the table, now glowing faintly with the same symbols as the device. It was a path, not just through time but through the truth.

He had spent so long running from his past, but now he had no choice. If Lila was still alive in another timeline, then he had to find her. He had to understand what had happened.

He took a deep breath and stepped toward the door of *the_hourglass_curios*. The air outside was colder, the sky darker than it should have been. But Jax didn’t care. He had a purpose now, something that felt real.

He would follow the echoes, not as a ghost but as a man trying to reclaim his life.

---

**Scene 5 (Continued): The Decision**

Jax’s boots echoed against the cobbled street outside the shop, the wind carrying the scent of rain and dust. He had spent so long in this place, surrounded by artifacts and memories, but now he felt like he was leaving something behind—something that had been holding him back for years.

He looked up at the sky, which seemed to stretch infinitely above him. The world around him felt different now, as if it were waiting for him to make a choice.

He had always believed that time was a force beyond his control, something he could only observe and never change. But now he saw that he *could* change it. That the echoes weren’t just remnants of the past—they were a path forward.

He reached into his pocket and pulled out the disc from Kael. It felt heavier now, like it held more than just information—it held a promise.

“I need to find her,” he said, almost to himself. “Not just remember her.”

The words felt different now, not just a whisper of guilt but a declaration of intent. He had spent years trying to escape the past, to forget the pain that had shaped him. But now, with the truth before him, he realized that the only way to move forward was to face it.

He turned back toward the shop, his steps slow but deliberate. The door creaked open behind him, and for a moment, he hesitated. He had spent so long in this place, but now he knew it wasn’t just a refuge—it was a starting point.

He stepped inside, the light from the device still glowing on the table. He looked at it, then at the map that had been waiting for him.

“I’ll follow the echoes,” he said, his voice steady. “I’ll find the truth.”

The shop seemed to breathe in response, its walls shifting slightly as if acknowledging his decision. He reached for the device again, feeling the warmth of it in his palm.

He wasn’t just a man haunted by time anymore. He was someone who had the power to change it—to stop running and finally face what had been done.

And if Lila was still out there, then he would find her.

Even if it meant confronting the people who had used him.

Even if it meant facing the truth about his own role in the fracture.

He closed his eyes for a moment, letting the weight of everything settle. Then, with a deep breath, he opened them again and stepped toward the device.

He wasn’t just a ghost anymore. He was *alive*.

And he had a purpose.

---

**Scene 5 (Continued): The Path Forward**

Jax’s fingers brushed the surface of the device once more, its glow intensifying as if it were responding to his resolve. The map beside it pulsed with light, the symbols shifting in patterns that felt like they were trying to tell him something.

He looked at the map, his mind racing with possibilities. If the fracture had been a test, then there must have been others—other agents, other timelines, other versions of himself. He needed to find them, to understand who had orchestrated this.

The shop seemed to hum around him, the air thick with energy. He could feel the weight of the past pressing down on him, but now it felt like he was standing on the edge of something new.

He reached for the disc from Kael, feeling its warmth as if it were a second key. “I’ll follow the echoes,” he said, his voice firm. “I’ll find the truth.”

The device responded with a low hum, and suddenly, the shop around him began to shift. The walls melted into new shapes, the floorboards groaned as if they were moving under his feet. And then, without warning, the room was gone.

He stood in another place now—somewhere he didn’t recognize. The air felt heavier, the light more intense. He looked around, and for a moment, he thought he had stepped into the past. But something told him this was different.

It was the first fracture.

The chamber before him was vast, its walls made of shifting light and shadow. In the center stood a pedestal, and on it rested a single artifact: a sphere of pure gold, its surface etched with the same symbols as the device in his hands.

He stepped closer, his breath shallow. “This is where it all started,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

The whispers returned, soft and insistent. “You were never meant to be alone. You were part of something greater.”

Jax clenched his fists. He had spent so long trying to forget, to convince himself that the fracture was his fault. But now, with the truth before him, he realized that he had been *used* for something far more dangerous.

He looked at the sphere, its glow steady. “I need to find out who did this,” he said, his voice firm. “Who used me.”

The chamber pulsed again, and the whispers grew louder. “You were just a key,” they said. “And now, you have to find the door.”

Jax’s mind reeled. He had spent years trying to escape the past, but now it felt like he was finally *inside* it. The echoes had shown him too much, and he wasn’t sure he could handle it all at once.

But one thing was clear: he couldn’t run from this anymore.

He reached out, fingers brushing the surface of the sphere. The moment he touched it, the chamber dissolved into light again, and he was back in *the_hourglass_curios*, the device still glowing on the table.

For the first time in years, Jax felt something close to peace. Not because he had forgotten, but because he had finally *understood*.

He looked at the device, its glow steady. “I need to find her,” he said, his voice firm. “Not just remember her.”

The shop around him seemed to breathe in response, as if it were listening. He reached for the map on the table, feeling its warmth in his hands.

“I’ll follow the echoes,” he said, almost to himself. “I’ll find the truth.”

He wasn’t just a man haunted by time anymore. He was someone who had the power to change it—to stop running and finally face what had been done.

And if Lila was still out there, then he would find her.

Even if it meant confronting the people who had used him.

Even if it meant facing the truth about his own role in the fracture.

He closed his eyes for a moment, letting the weight of everything settle. Then, with a deep breath, he opened them again and stepped toward the device.

He wasn’t just a ghost anymore. He was *alive*.

And he had a purpose.
