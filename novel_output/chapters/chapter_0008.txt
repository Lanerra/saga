The Hourglass Curios was never meant to be a place of refuge. It was built in the shadow of time itself, nestled in an Eddy Reality that had long since stopped moving. Flickering lanterns cast long, wavering shadows across the creaking wooden floors, their light dim and unreliable, as though time itself were unsure whether it should stay or flee. The scent of old paper and ozone clung to the air, mingling with the faint hum of something ancient and restless beneath the surface. Jax had spent years in this shop, surrounded by relics from forgotten timelines, but tonight felt different. The silence was heavier, the dust more settled, as if the shop had been waiting.

He sat at his desk, hunched over a stack of yellowed journals and half-finished sketches, the glow of the device on his table casting strange patterns across the pages. It had been weeks since he’d found it—weeks since he’d begun to understand its purpose. The device pulsed with a golden light, as if it were alive, as if it were waiting for him to finally listen. He had tried to ignore it, to convince himself that his life was over and that the past was nothing more than ghosts in the machine. But tonight, something had shifted.

The shop was quiet, save for the occasional creak of the floorboards or the soft whirr of a clock hidden behind a false wall. Jax’s fingers drummed against the wooden surface as he stared at the device, his mind racing. He had spent so long running from the truth that even now, when it finally caught up to him, he wasn’t sure what to do with it. The Great Timeline Fracture—his greatest failure, the reason he’d abandoned the Temporal Concord and buried himself in this shop—had never been an accident. Someone had done it on purpose.

He exhaled sharply, rubbing his temples. “I don’t have time for this,” he muttered, though the words felt hollow even as they left his lips. He had no idea what to do with the knowledge now that he had it. The device was a key, he knew, but to what? And why had it chosen him?

The shop door creaked open.

Jax stiffened, his hand drifting toward the antique revolver on the desk. He hadn’t fired it in years, not since the last time he’d felt like he needed to. But the presence of a stranger in his sanctuary—his only home—was enough to make him alert.

The figure stepped inside, cloaked in shifting shadows that seemed to ripple like ink in water. Jax’s eyes narrowed as he studied the form before him. It was humanoid, but not entirely. The edges of the cloak blurred, the face indistinct, and when he tried to focus on it, it would shift again—like a mirage caught between realities.

“You were never the cause,” the figure said, their voice layered with echoes, as if speaking from multiple places at once. “You were the last warning.”

Jax’s jaw tightened. “Who are you?”

The figure tilted their head, and for a moment, Jax thought he saw something familiar in their face—something that flickered like a memory just out of reach. But before he could place it, it vanished.

“The Watcher,” they said, the name rolling off their tongue like a secret. “I’ve watched you from many timelines. Some where you failed. Others where you succeeded. But none where you escaped.”

Jax’s pulse quickened. He had been told by Lila—his former partner, now an echo of the past—that he was haunted by the fracture. That it was not just a memory but a presence that followed him. And now this stranger, this Watcher, seemed to confirm it.

“You’re not real,” Jax said, his voice edged with doubt. “You’re another ghost.”

The Watcher chuckled, a sound like wind through broken glass. “I am as real as the choices you’ve made. The timelines are unraveling, Jax. Cohort Zero is coming.”

Jax’s breath caught. He’d heard the name before, whispered in the dark corners of his mind like a curse. Cohort Zero—those who believed that time should be perfect, that all deviations must be erased to maintain order.

“They believe chaos is a flaw,” the Watcher continued, stepping closer. “They are not just an enemy. They are a force. A design. And they will not stop until the multiverse is one.”

Jax’s fingers curled around the revolver. “Why should I believe you?”

The Watcher raised a hand, and the shadows around them coalesced into a shape—something like a clock, but with gears that moved in reverse. The image was both mesmerizing and terrifying.

“Because you were meant to be the last echo,” they said. “Before they erase everything.”

Jax’s eyes darted to the device on the table. He had been told it was tied to the fracture, to Lila, but now he wondered if it was something more. A key? A warning?

“I need more than riddles,” he said, his voice low. “I need answers.”

The Watcher tilted their head again, as if considering his words. Then they spoke, slow and deliberate.

“Find her before it’s too late.”

Jax frowned. “Who?”

“The one who remembers.”

He didn’t answer immediately. The weight of the words settled in his chest like a stone. Lila. She had been the one who had first brought him to this place, to this life. She was the reason he had stopped running.

But why would she be the one who remembers?

The Watcher’s form began to dissolve, their edges fraying like torn fabric. “I cannot stay. But I have given you what you need.”

Jax reached out instinctively, but the figure was already gone, leaving only the sound of rustling shadows and the faintest whisper in the air.

He stared at the device, its golden light pulsing in time with his heartbeat. It had always been there, waiting. And now it was telling him something he couldn’t ignore.

The next morning, Jax found himself standing in the back room of the shop, where the walls were lined with artifacts that shimmered faintly in the dim light. He hadn’t intended to come here, but the device had drawn him. It hummed softly now, as if it were alive, and he could feel its pull like a current beneath the surface.

He picked up the device, his fingers brushing against the strange symbols etched into its surface. They glowed faintly under his touch, and for a moment, the room seemed to shift—time bending around him like a river with no shore.

Then he saw it.

A vision, not of the past but of an alternate present. The shop was the same, yet different. The lanterns flickered more violently, the air thick with tension. He stood in the same spot, but the walls were lined with something else—something he didn’t recognize.

A figure moved through the room, their presence sharp and defined. It was Lila. But not the Lila he remembered. This version of her was younger, stronger, her eyes filled with a fire he hadn’t seen in years. She was searching for something, her hands moving over the same artifacts that now lay before him.

Jax’s breath caught. He had never seen her like this. Never thought she would be here—now, in this moment, in this reality.

“I was there,” the vision of Lila said, her voice echoing through the space. “I saw what happened. I saw everything you tried to protect.”

Jax clenched his fists. “What happened?”

She turned to him, and for a moment, he felt the weight of her gaze as if she were looking through him. “You didn’t stop them. You let them in.”

His stomach twisted. He had always believed that he had failed because he hadn’t been strong enough, because he hadn’t acted quickly enough. But this vision suggested something else—something deeper.

He looked down at the device, its golden glow intensifying. “Why are you here?”

Lila’s expression darkened. “Because I’m not just a memory. I’m a warning. And if you don’t listen, everything will be lost.”

The vision flickered, and Jax was pulled back into the present. The shop was silent again, the air still heavy with something unspoken. He dropped to his knees, the weight of the revelation pressing down on him like a lead cloak.

He had always thought he was running from the past. But now, he realized, he was running from himself.

---

Jax’s fingers trembled as he reached for the phone. It was an old relic, a rotary dial number that had been in his shop for years. He hadn’t used it since the fracture, but something about the device made him feel like it was time to reach out again.

He dialed the number, and after several rings, a voice answered.

“Dr. Kael,” he said, his tone cautious. “I need to talk.”

There was a pause on the other end. Then, “You’re not the only one who’s been looking for you.”

Jax’s breath caught. “What are you talking about?”

Kael’s voice was low and measured, like a man who had seen too much. “You’re not just running from your past, Jax. You’re running from something bigger. Cohort Zero is moving. They’ve been watching you. And they know what you can do.”

Jax exhaled sharply. “I don’t have time for this. I need to find Lila.”

Kael sighed. “She’s not just a person, Jax. She’s a fragment of the fracture itself. A living echo. If you want to find her, you’ll have to go where the timelines break—where they’re unstable.”

Jax frowned. “What do you mean?”

“There are places in the multiverse where time doesn’t hold. Places called Fracture Zones. They’re dangerous. You could be lost forever.”

“I’ve been through worse,” Jax said, his voice steady despite the unease curling in his gut.

Kael hesitated. “Then I’ll help you. But be careful. You don’t know who you can trust.”

Jax looked down at the device again, its golden light pulsing like a heartbeat. “I’ve always trusted myself. Maybe that’s why I failed.”

He hung up the phone and stood, his mind racing. He had to find Lila, but how? And more importantly, what did it mean that she was an echo of the fracture?

The shop felt smaller now, as if the walls were closing in. The air was thick with something he couldn’t name—something like regret, or maybe guilt.

He made his way to the back room, where the device had first appeared. He placed it on the table and activated it, its glow casting strange patterns across the walls. The symbols flared to life, and for a moment, the shop seemed to breathe.

Then the shadows moved again.

They formed into a shape—Kael’s face, but not quite. It was like a reflection that had been bent out of recognition. His voice was deeper, more resonant.

“You were never meant to be alone,” Kael said. “You have a purpose now. The fracture is not just a wound in time—it’s a door. And you’re the only one who can open it.”

Jax looked up, his eyes narrowed. “What do you mean by that?”

Kael’s image flickered. “The Concord tried to erase it. But they couldn’t. Because you were part of it. You were its key. And now, Cohort Zero is trying to take that key from you.”

Jax felt something shift inside him—something he hadn’t felt since the fracture. A sense of urgency. A need to act.

He reached for the device, feeling the pulse of time beneath his fingers. “Then I’ll find Lila. I’ll find out what happened. And I’ll stop them if I have to.”

Kael’s image smiled, though it was a strange, almost sad expression. “You’re not just stopping them. You’re saving yourself.”

Jax didn’t respond. He simply turned and walked out of the shop, the device glowing in his hand like a beacon.

---

The journey to the Fracture Zone was unlike anything Jax had ever experienced. The air felt heavier, the light dimmer, as though time itself were resisting him. He moved through shifting realities, each one more unstable than the last. At times, he saw glimpses of himself—versions of him that had made different choices, versions that had failed or succeeded in ways he could never know.

He found himself standing in a place where the sky was a swirling mass of colors, and the ground beneath his feet seemed to ripple like water. This was the Fracture Zone—a place where the laws of time no longer applied, where the past, present, and future collided in chaotic bursts.

He activated the device, its golden light expanding outward, illuminating the space around him. The symbols on its surface pulsed in rhythm with his heartbeat, as if it were guiding him through this madness.

Then he saw her.

Lila stood at the edge of a crumbling structure, her form flickering like a candle in the wind. She looked up as he approached, her eyes filled with something he hadn’t seen in years—hope.

“I thought I’d never find you,” Jax said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Lila’s lips curled into a faint smile. “I’ve been waiting for you.”

He took a step closer, the device still in his hand. “What are you doing here?”

She gestured to the ruins around them. “This is where the fracture began. This is where your past and future collide.”

Jax looked around, taking in the strange architecture that seemed to defy logic. It was as if the structure had been built from different times—pieces of history scattered like puzzle fragments.

“I need to know what happened,” he said. “Why I failed.”

Lila’s expression darkened. “Because you didn’t understand what you were holding. --- BEGIN REPLACE_WITH TEXT ---
... the fracture itself. A living echo. If you want to find her, you’ll have to go where the timelines break—where they’re unstable.”

Jax frowned. “What do you mean?”

“There are places in the multiverse where time doesn’t hold. Places called Fracture Zones. They’re dangerous. You could be lost forever.”

Jax looked around, taking in the strange architecture that seemed to defy logic. It was as if the structure had been built from different times—pieces of history scattered like puzzle fragments.

“I need to know what happened,” he said. “Why I failed.”

Lila’s expression darkened. “Because you didn’t understand what you were holding. The device isn’t just a tool—it’s a key. It reveals the truth about the fracture, the choices that led to it, and the paths you could have taken.”

Jax looked down at the device again, its glow now steady. “What does that mean for me to be the key?”

Lila’s voice was softer now. “It means you were never meant to forget. You were meant to remember. To fight. To change what was supposed to be fixed.”

Jax felt a wave of emotion crash over him—guilt, regret, but also something else. Something like resolve.

“I can’t let it happen again,” he said.

Lila nodded. “Then you have to go back. To the beginning.”

He looked at her, then at the device, and finally back at her. “I don’t know if I can do this.”

She stepped closer, her voice steady. “You don’t have to. But you will. Because it’s your only chance.”

Jax closed his eyes for a moment, letting the weight of her words settle. He had spent so long running from the truth that he hadn’t realized how much he had been avoiding—how much he had been hiding from himself.

He looked at Lila, then at the device, and finally back at her. “I don’t know if I can do this.”

She pointed to the structure behind them, its walls etched with symbols that mirrored those on the device. “The fracture wasn’t just a mistake. It was a test. A way for the Concord to see if you could resist their control. And you did. But they erased it anyway.”

Jax’s breath caught. “They didn’t want me to remember.”

Lila shook her head. “They wanted you to forget. To be safe. But time doesn’t work that way. It remembers. It waits. And now, it’s giving you another chance.”

Jax looked at the device again, its golden light pulsing in time with his thoughts. “And if I fail this time?”

A voice echoed through the ruins, not from the figures but from somewhere deeper. “It means you can see what others cannot.” It shows not only the past but the possibilities of the future.”

Jax frowned. “Then why show me this?”

“Because you have to see it,” she said. “You have to understand that your choices matter. That even in the chaos, there is meaning.”

He looked down at the device again, its glow now steady. “What does it mean for me to be the key?”

Lila’s voice was softer now. “It means you were never meant to forget. You were meant to remember. To fight. To change what was supposed to be fixed.”

He looked at the device again, its golden light pulsing in time with his thoughts. “And if I fail this time?”

Lila’s eyes met his, and for the first time, she didn’t look like an echo. She looked like a woman who had seen the end of the world and still stood.

“Then you’ll have to face it,” she said. “But not alone.”

Jax felt something shift in his chest. He had spent so long running from the truth that he hadn’t realized how much he had been avoiding—how much he had been hiding from himself.

He looked at Lila, then at the device, and finally back at her. “I don’t know if I can do this.”

She stepped closer, her voice steady. “You don’t have to. But you will. Because it’s your only chance.”

Jax closed his eyes for a moment, letting the weight of her words settle. He had spent years believing he was a failure, that his past had defined him. But now, he saw something different.

He wasn’t just a victim of time. He was its key.

And maybe, just maybe, he could rewrite it.

---

Jax’s journey to the Fracture Zone had been long and treacherous, but he had made it. Now, standing at the edge of the chaos, he felt the pull of something vast—something that had been waiting for him all along.

He activated the device once more, its golden light expanding into a sphere around him. The symbols on its surface flared, and for a moment, he felt as though he were being pulled into a different reality.

The world around him shifted.

He found himself standing in the ruins of Temporal Hub Prime—a place that had once been the heart of the Concord, now abandoned and crumbling. The air was thick with the scent of ozone, and the walls bore the scars of countless timelines colliding and breaking apart.

He saw figures moving through the ruins, their forms flickering like ghosts caught in the light. They were Cohort Zero—shifting, glitch-like, but unmistakably hostile.

Jax’s heart pounded as he stepped forward, his mind racing with questions. Who were they? What did they want? And why had they been after him all this time?

He reached for the device again, its glow now a steady beacon in the chaos. “You said I was the key,” he muttered. “What does that mean?”

A voice echoed through the ruins, not from the figures but from somewhere deeper. “It means you can see what others cannot.”

Jax turned, his eyes scanning the shadows. He didn’t see anyone, but he felt something watching him.

He took a step back, his hand tightening around the device. “Who’s there?”

The voice came again, clearer this time. “The Watcher.”

Jax’s breath caught. He had heard that name before, in riddles and whispers. He looked up at the sky, which was an impossible mix of colors—deep blues, fiery reds, and silver streaks that moved like lightning across the void. It was a place where time didn’t make sense, where the past, present, and future collided in chaotic bursts. He had spent years avoiding this moment, but now it was here. The past was no longer a ghost—it was a presence, and he had to understand it.

He looked around at the ruins, at the flickering figures that moved like shadows through the air. They were Cohort Zero—enforcers of order, destroyers of chaos. And they were here now, waiting for him to make his move. He could feel their eyes on him, watching, waiting. But he wasn’t alone in this fight.

The Watcher was not just a figure of the past but a presence across timelines. They had been there before, in the moments when Jax had been lost in the echoes of his own mind. They had watched as he struggled with the weight of his ability, as he tried to outrun the truth. Now, they stood at the edge of the Fracture Zone, their form shifting like a mirage in the temporal storm.

"You were never the cause," the Watcher said, their voice layered with echoes from countless timelines. "You were the last warning. A key to something far greater than yourself."

Jax’s fingers tightened around the device. "Then why did they erase me?"

The Watcher’s form flickered again, their edges dissolving into light. "Because they feared what you could do. They feared your ability to perceive temporal echoes. But you are not alone in this fight. You have a purpose beyond the fractures of time."

Jax felt something shift inside him. He had always known he could see the echoes, but now it felt different. As if the device was unlocking a part of himself he hadn’t realized was there. He looked at the Watcher, their shifting form a reminder that they were not just a whisper from the past, but a presence that had watched over him through the chaos of time.

"Then I’ll show them what I can do," Jax said, his voice steady despite the fear in his chest. "I won’t let history repeat itself."

The Watcher’s form flickered again, their edges dissolving into light. "You have to find the source of the fracture. That is your only hope."“You were never the cause,” the Watcher said, their voice layered with echoes. “You were the last warning.”

Jax looked up, his mind reeling. “Then why did they erase me?”

The Watcher’s form flickered, their edges dissolving like ink in water. “Because they feared what you could do. They feared your ability to perceive temporal echoes.”

Jax felt something shift inside him. He had always known he could see the echoes, but now it felt different. As if the device was unlocking a part of himself he hadn’t realized was there.

He stepped forward, his voice steady despite the fear in his chest. “Then I’ll show them what I can do.”

The Watcher’s form solidified for a moment, their eyes locking onto his with something like approval. “You have to find the source of the fracture. That is your only hope.”

Jax nodded. “And how do I do that?”

The Watcher’s voice was softer now, almost mournful. “By following the echoes. By understanding what they mean. And by facing the truth about who you are.”

He looked down at the device again, its golden light pulsing in time with his thoughts. He had spent so long running from the past that he hadn’t realized how much it had shaped him. How much it had defined him.

And now, he had a choice.

He could continue to run. To hide from the truth and let history repeat itself.

Or he could face it.

And maybe, just maybe, change it.

---

Jax’s hands trembled as he turned the device over in his palms, its golden light casting strange patterns across the crumbling walls of Temporal Hub Prime. He had spent years avoiding this moment, but now it was here. The past was no longer a ghost—it was a presence, and he had to understand it.

He looked up at the sky, which was an impossible mix of colors—deep blues, fiery reds, and silver streaks that moved like lightning across the void. It was a place where time didn’t make sense, where the past, present, and future collided in chaotic bursts.

He took a deep breath, feeling the weight of everything he had learned. The Great Timeline Fracture wasn’t just an accident. It was a test. A way for the Concord to see if he could resist their control. And he had. But they had erased it anyway.

He had been a pawn in something far larger than himself. And now, he had to find out who had used him. Who had caused the fracture. And why.

The device pulsed again, its glow intensifying. He felt the pull of time, as if it were leading him somewhere.

Somewhere where the truth awaited.

He stepped forward, his mind racing with possibilities. He had spent years avoiding the truth, but now it was here. The past was no longer a ghost—it was a presence, and he had to understand it. He could go back to the Concord and demand answers. But they wouldn’t give them. They had already decided that he was too dangerous, not just for himself, but for the timelines they sought to control.

The device pulsed again, its golden light casting strange patterns across the crumbling walls of Temporal Hub Prime. He had been a pawn in something far larger than himself, and now he had to find out who had used him. Who had caused the fracture. And why.

The Watcher’s form flickered once more, their edges dissolving into light. "You are not alone in this fight," they said, their voice layered with echoes. "There is another who walks the echoes, a woman born in an alternate timeline, who sees what you see. She is Mira."

Jax turned, his eyes scanning the shadows. He had never met her before, but he felt something in the air—something familiar. A presence that had been waiting for him, just as he had. 

Mira. The name had been whispered in the dark, a promise of help when the Concord would not listen. She claimed to have been born in an alternate timeline and possessed the ability to navigate temporal echoes. If she was real, if she could help him, then maybe he wasn’t alone in this fight.

But for now, he had to follow the device. It was the only thing that had ever given him a sense of purpose, even when he didn’t want it. He looked around at the ruins, at the flickering figures that moved like shadows through the air. They were Cohort Zero—enforcers of order, destroyers of chaos. And they were here now, waiting for him to make his move.

Jax’s fingers tightened around the device. "I don’t know if I can do this."

The Watcher’s form flickered again, their edges dissolving into light. "Then you must believe in yourself." But they wouldn’t give them. They had already decided that he was too dangerous.

Or he could find Mira—his soon-to-be ally. She claimed to have been born in an alternate timeline and possessed the ability to navigate temporal echoes. If she was real, if she could help him, then maybe he wasn’t alone in this fight.

But for now, he had to follow the device. It was the only thing that had ever given him a sense of purpose, even when he didn’t want it.

He looked around at the ruins, at the flickering figures that moved like shadows through the air. They were Cohort Zero—enforcers of order, destroyers of chaos. And they were here now, waiting for him to make his move.

Jax’s fingers tightened around the device. “I don’t know if I can do this.”

The Watcher’s voice echoed once more, steady and resolute. “Then you must believe in yourself.”

He looked up, meeting the shifting gaze of the Watcher. For a moment, he felt something inside him shift—something like clarity.

“I don’t have to be afraid,” he said, his voice quiet but firm. “Because I’ve already seen what happens if I do.”

The Watcher’s form flickered again, their edges dissolving into light. “Then you must choose wisely, Jax Xenobia.”

He didn’t answer. He simply turned and walked deeper into the ruins, the device glowing in his hand like a promise.

He had spent so long running from the truth that he hadn’t realized how much it had shaped him. How much it had defined him.

And now, he had to face it.

To find the source of the fracture.

To reclaim his purpose.

Because if he didn’t, then everything would be lost again.

And this time, he wouldn’t let it happen.
