The air inside the Memory Vault’s core chamber was thick with static and sorrow, a place where the weight of stolen lives pressed against the walls like an unrelenting tide. Sága stepped forward, her boots echoing in the vast emptiness, the glow of data streams casting shifting shadows across the room. Aelric moved beside her, his eyes scanning the pulsating memory pods that floated in midair, each one a vessel of someone else’s past.

“This is it,” Sága whispered, her voice barely above the hum of the machinery. “The source of everything.”

Aelric nodded, his jaw tight. “We have to shut it down before it’s too late.”

They moved deeper into the chamber, where the core system loomed like a mechanical heart, its rhythmic pulse syncing with the faint tremor in Sága’s chest. It was here that the Exchange fed on the memories of the city, siphoning them away until nothing remained but hollowed-out husks of people who had given too much.

Then she saw her sister.

The figure stood at the edge of a cluster of memory pods, their flickering light reflecting in her hollow eyes. The once-vibrant woman Sága had known as a child was now a shadow of herself, her body thin and gaunt, her voice trembling with something that might have been regret or despair.

“I used to believe in this,” the sister said, her gaze locking onto Sága’s. “Now I only remember the pain.”

Sága’s breath caught. She had seen her sister before—briefly, in the Outskirts, when she had first begun to question the Exchange—but now, standing in the heart of its corruption, the truth was undeniable. This was what had happened to her. What had been done to so many others.

“You’re the only one who can end it,” the sister continued, stepping closer. “You know what it’s done to us. You’ve felt it.”

Aelric placed a hand on Sága’s shoulder, grounding her. She wanted to deny it, to run, but she knew there was no turning back. The memories of her childhood, stolen in increments over the years, had left her with gaps and questions that now burned like embers in her mind.

“I don’t know if I can,” Sága admitted, voice low.

Her sister reached out, fingers brushing against her arm. “You have to try.”

Before Sága could respond, a shadow moved behind them. Her father stepped into the light, his presence as heavy as the machines around them. He looked older than she remembered, his face lined with exhaustion and sorrow. His eyes, once filled with hope, now held only regret.

“I built this,” he said, voice rough with emotion. “To save lives. But it took more than I could give.”

Sága’s stomach twisted. She had always believed her father was the kind of man who would fight for his family, not trade them away. But now, standing before him, she saw the truth. He had made a choice, just like everyone else, to survive.

“You have to choose, Sága,” he said, stepping forward. “You can walk away and live. Or you can end this.”

She looked between her father and sister, both of them caught in the system they had helped create. The weight of their gazes bore down on her, but she did not falter.

“I choose to end it,” she said at last.

Aelric gave a small nod of approval. “Then let’s do this.”

As if summoned by her words, Mira appeared from the shadows, her presence a sharp contrast to the cold machinery around them. She had once been an Enforcer, a hunter of those like Sága who resisted the system. Now, she stood with them, her expression resolute.

“I’ve seen what it does to people,” Mira said. “I can’t let it continue.”

Sága turned to her, surprised. “You’re here to help?”

Mira met her gaze. “Yes. I want redemption. And maybe, just maybe, I can help you get yours.”

Aelric led them toward the central console, where a sleek, metallic interface awaited. The Neural Interface—Memory Siphon—was already connected, its wires snaking across the floor toward a waiting figure. It was Sága.

“I’ll have to interface with the core,” she said, stepping forward. “It’s the only way to override it.”

Aelric hesitated. “That’s dangerous. You might not come back.”

“I know,” Sága replied. “But if I don’t do this, no one will.”

She pressed her temple against the siphon, feeling the cold metal press into her skin. The moment she connected, a flood of memories surged through her—fragments of lives stolen, voices crying out in despair, the weight of countless souls trapped within the Vault’s grasp.

“I can feel them,” she whispered, eyes wide as they flickered with the echoes of others. “All of them.”

Aelric steadied her. “You have to stay focused. This is what you’ve been fighting for.”

The system resisted. Alarms blared, and the core chamber trembled as the Vault fought back against their intrusion. Data streams surged wildly, memory pods flickering and crashing as the system tried to repel them.

“It’s fighting back,” Aelric shouted over the noise. “We need you to override it.”

Sága gritted her teeth, forcing herself to stay calm. She reached into the chaos, searching for the command sequence that would trigger the self-destruct protocol. Her sister stepped beside her, gripping her hand tightly.

“You could run,” the sister said. “Or you could end this.”

“I’ve already lost everything,” Sága whispered. “I don’t want to lose you too.”

Her sister squeezed her hand. “Then help me remember.”

Sága’s fingers moved faster, her mind a blur of code and stolen recollections. She could feel the Vault resisting, its defenses growing stronger with each second. It was trying to keep them from destroying it.

Aelric’s voice cut through the noise. “It’s not going to let go easily.”

“I’ll do what I have to,” Sága said, her resolve hardening. “I’ll take it down with me.”

She reached for the final command, her body trembling as the system tried to consume her. The memories of those trapped inside surged through her mind, overwhelming her senses. She saw her sister’s face, her father’s, Mira’s. She saw the faces of strangers who had given everything for a chance at survival.

And then she saw herself—childhood Sága, standing in the Outskirts, questioning why people traded their memories for life. That girl had been so small, so full of wonder. Now, she was the one who would end it all.

“I’ll take it down with me,” she whispered again, this time to the system itself.

The core chamber exploded in light as the self-destruct sequence activated. The Memory Vault shuddered violently, its walls cracking under the strain. Sága felt her body begin to fade, her consciousness dissolving into the very thing she had fought to destroy.

Aelric reached for her, but she was already gone.

As the Vault collapsed around them, Aelric pulled out a small device from his coat—a memory recorder. He knelt beside Sága’s fading form, pressing it against her temple as her final thoughts poured into him.

“Live as if every moment matters,” he heard her say. “Don’t let fear define you.”

He looked up at the crumbling structure above them, the echoes of her voice still ringing in his ears. “This is for everyone who lost their memories,” she whispered.

The Vault groaned one last time before the lights flickered and died.

Outside, the city of Erevan stirred. People who had spent years in a haze of memory-induced stupor began to wake, blinking into the cold morning light. The air felt different—lighter, as if something oppressive had finally lifted.

Aelric stood at the edge of the ruins, watching the city slowly come back to life. It was broken, but it was alive. He held Sága’s final message close, knowing that her sacrifice would not be in vain.

“The system is gone,” he said to no one in particular. “But the scars remain.”

Mira joined him, her gaze also fixed on the city. “We saved people,” she murmured. “But we also lost something.”

Aelric nodded. “Maybe that’s the price of freedom.”

They walked through the ruins of the Memory Vault, the silence between them heavy with all they had lost and all they had gained. The path ahead was uncertain, but for the first time in a long time, it felt like something worth fighting for.

In the core chamber, Sága’s sister knelt before the remnants of the Vault, her hands trembling as she whispered a prayer for the memories she had once thought lost forever.

“I remember now,” she said. “Not just the pain, but the love.”

She looked up at the sky, where the first rays of sunlight broke through the ruins. “Thank you, Sága.”

And in that moment, the city of Erevan began to remember.
