The air in The Hourglass Curios was thick with dust and the scent of old paper, like a graveyard of forgotten knowledge. Jax Xenobia stood in the dim glow of flickering lanterns, his fingers tracing the worn brass of an antique pocket watch that had sat untouched on the counter for weeks. It was a relic he had purchased from a shadowy dealer in the Fracture Zone—something that didn’t belong to any one timeline, yet seemed to hum with a presence that refused to be ignored.

He had never been much for clocks. Time had always been an enemy, something he’d spent years trying to outrun. But now, as he stared at the watch, something in its surface shimmered, like heat rising off pavement on a summer day. The light wasn’t natural. It was *wrong*. A ripple spread through the air, and for a moment, the shop seemed to bend inward, as though it were folding over itself.

Then, the anomaly appeared.

It was a thin, wavering line of light that coalesced into a shape—humanoid, but not quite human. The figure was shifting, glitching between forms like a broken projector reel. Jax’s breath caught in his throat. He had seen temporal echoes before, but never like this. This wasn’t just an echo; it was *action*. A living, breathing presence that moved through time as if it were the very fabric of it.

He stepped back, his boots scuffing against the wooden floorboards. The shop seemed to hold its breath. Even the dust hung still in the air, as though waiting for something to break the silence.

“Jax,” Dr. Varen Kael’s voice came from behind him, low and urgent. He had been watching from the shadows of the back room, his presence barely more than a whisper against the walls. “This isn’t supposed to exist.”

Jax turned sharply, his eyes narrowing as he took in the man’s silhouette. Dr. Kael was dressed in a long coat that looked like it had been stitched together from different eras—1920s tailoring on one side, something more modern on the other. His face was lined with years of secrets, and his gaze was sharp enough to cut through time itself.

“What is it?” Jax asked, his voice hoarse. He had expected to see echoes, but this was something else. Something *active*.

“It’s Cohort Zero,” Kael said, stepping into the light. The air in The Hourglass Curios was thick with dust and the scent of old paper, like a graveyard of forgotten knowledge. Jax Xenobia stood in the dim glow of flickering lanterns, his fingers tracing the worn brass of an antique pocket watch that had sat untouched on the counter for weeks. It was a relic he had purchased from a shadowy dealer in the Fracture Zone—something that didn’t belong to any one timeline, yet seemed to hum with a presence that refused to be ignored.

Jax’s breath caught in his throat. He had seen temporal echoes before, but never like this. This wasn’t just an echo; it was *action*. A living, breathing presence that moved through time as if it were the very fabric of it.  

He stepped back, his boots scuffing against the floorboards. The shop seemed to hold its breath. Even the dust hung still in the air, as though waiting for something to break the silence.  

“They’re pruning a minor timeline,” Dr. Varen Kael said, his voice low and urgent. Jax had heard whispers of Cohort Zero—rumors of a shadowy force that operated beyond the Temporal Concord’s jurisdiction, rewriting history to fit their vision of an *Optimal Timeline*. But he had never seen them in action. Never felt their presence so clearly.  

Jax’s hands trembled. He had spent years running from the truth, from the echoes that haunted him, from the guilt that clung to him like a second skin. But this was different. This wasn’t just a memory or a mistake—it was a *choice*. Someone had decided to remove a life, and now he was seeing it.  

“You’ve known about them, haven’t you?” Kael’s voice softened, his eyes searching Jax’s face. “You’ve seen their echoes in the past. You’ve been avoiding them, but not escaping them.”  

Jax’s jaw tightened. “I’ve been trying to forget.”  

Kael nodded. “Forgetting won’t protect you. They’ve been watching. Pruning. Waiting for the right moment to act.”  

The figure in the air flickered again, and Jax felt the weight of it settle in his chest. He had always believed he was a victim of the fracture, but now, the truth pressed against him like a blade. This was no accident. This was *them*. And they had been waiting.Jax’s heart pounded. He had heard whispers of Cohort Zero—rumors of a shadowy force that operated beyond the Temporal Concord’s jurisdiction, rewriting history to fit their vision of an *Optimal Timeline*. But he had never seen them in action. Never felt their presence so clearly.

“What do you mean, pruning?” Jax asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Kael gestured toward the shimmering figure. “They don’t just erase events. They erase people. Entire lives. You see it? The echo is *real*—but it’s not real in the way we think. It’s a fragment of a timeline they’ve decided to remove.”

Jax felt something cold coil in his stomach. He had spent years running from the truth, from the echoes that haunted him, from the guilt that clung to him like a second skin. But this was different. This wasn’t just a memory or a mistake—it was a *choice*. Someone had decided to remove a life, and now he was seeing it.

“Why would they do that?” Jax asked, his voice tight with suspicion.

Kael’s expression darkened. “Because every deviation from the 'Optimal' path is a threat. They believe history must be pure, without interference or unpredictability. You were their first target because of what you can see.”

Jax looked down at the watch, its surface now reflecting something more than just light. It showed him a scene—his own face, distorted and flickering, standing in the middle of a chaos he couldn’t remember. People around him were falling, their bodies dissolving into nothingness as time unraveled. He had *seen* that before, in his dreams, but never with such clarity.

He reached out, fingers hovering over the watch’s surface, and the image shifted. It was no longer just a memory—it was an *event*. A moment when he had failed to stop something. When he had let it happen.

“I didn’t save them,” Jax said, his voice cracking. “I let them die.”

Kael nodded slowly. “You can see echoes of the past, but you can’t change them. Only watch. That’s what they fear in you—your awareness. Your ability to *know* what was lost.”

Jax turned away, his hands clenching into fists. The shop around him felt heavier now, as though the very walls were pressing in on his guilt.

“I thought I could escape it,” he muttered, more to himself than to Kael. “Thought this place would be safe.”

Kael stepped closer, his voice softer now. “You can’t run from time, Jax. You can only try to understand it.”

Jax looked up at him, eyes searching for something—truth, reassurance, or maybe even a way out. But Kael only met his gaze with quiet certainty.

“I’m here because I believe you can help us find the source of the original fracture,” Kael said. “The one that led to the Great Timeline Fracture. We think it’s connected to Cohort Zero. That they *caused* it.”

Jax exhaled sharply, his mind racing. He had always believed the fracture was an accident, a consequence of his failure. But now, this new information—this *pruning*—suggested something far worse.

“You’re saying the fracture wasn’t an accident,” Jax said, his voice low and bitter. “You’re saying they *planned* for it.”

Kael’s jaw tightened. “They didn’t plan for you. But they were prepared to eliminate anyone who might disrupt their vision of history.”

Jax felt a chill run through him. He had always known he was different, that his ability to see echoes made him a target. But now, the weight of that knowledge pressed down on him like a lead coat.

“I can’t change what’s already happened,” he said, his voice almost pleading. “I can only remember.”

Kael studied him for a long moment before nodding. “That’s why we need you. You’re the only one who can see what they’ve hidden.”

The shop felt smaller now, like it had been compressed by the enormity of what Kael was telling him. Jax’s fingers tightened around the edge of the counter as he tried to steady himself.

“What do you want me to do?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Kael’s eyes flickered with something unreadable. “We need to find out why they targeted you. Why they let the fracture happen. And we need to stop them before they erase *everything*.”

Jax looked at the watch again, its surface now dark and still. The echo had faded, but the sensation of it lingered in his bones. He had been a target. A threat. A variable they couldn’t afford.

He turned back to Kael, his expression unreadable. “I don’t know if I can do that.”

Kael’s lips curled into a faint smile. “You already are. You’ve been doing it since the day you first saw an echo.”

Jax didn’t respond. He wasn’t sure he could. The weight of the truth was too much to carry, and yet, there was no turning back now.

**Scene Number: 1 – The Anomaly in the Shop**

The shop had always been a refuge for Jax. A place where time moved slower, where memories could be buried beneath layers of dust and forgotten objects. He had built it as a sanctuary from the chaos of the multiverse, from the guilt that clung to him like a second skin.

But now, the sanctuary felt like a prison.

The shimmering figure near the pocket watch was still there, though now it hovered in midair, its form flickering between different versions of itself. One moment it looked like a young man, then an older one, then something in between—like time had tried to erase it but couldn’t quite manage.

Jax stepped closer, his boots making soft thuds against the floor. He could feel the energy around him shift, like the air itself was holding its breath. This wasn’t just a vision. It was *reality*.

He reached out, hesitating for a moment before touching the surface of the watch. The moment his fingers met it, the figure solidified, and Jax felt himself pulled into the echo.

It was a memory—not his own, but one that had been forced upon him. He stood in a dimly lit room, surrounded by flickering holograms of people who looked like they were caught in a storm of time. One of them was Lila, her face familiar yet distant, as though he had only seen it in a dream.

She turned to him, her eyes wide with fear. “Jax, you have to stop them.”

He didn’t understand. “Who?”

“The ones who are trying to erase the truth,” she said, her voice trembling. “They don’t want anyone to remember what happened. Not even *you*.”

The echo shifted again, and Jax found himself standing in a different moment—one where he had failed to stop a timeline from fracturing. He had been there, in that room, but he didn’t remember how he got there. The scene was too vivid, too real, as though it were happening now.

He tried to move, but the echo held him in place. “I didn’t save them,” he whispered. “I let them die.”

Lila’s face blurred, and then she was gone. Jax stumbled back from the memory, his hands shaking. The shop felt colder now, as though it had absorbed the chill of that moment.

Kael’s voice broke through the silence. “You’re not alone in this, Jax. You never were.”

Jax turned to face him, his expression unreadable. “What do you mean?”

Kael stepped closer, his coat rustling like wind through a graveyard. “They’ve been watching you. Testing your resolve. But they underestimated you. You can see what they’re doing. You can *feel* it.*

“I was their first target,” Jax said, his voice barely above a whisper. “And I failed.”

Kael’s eyes darkened. “That doesn’t mean you’re powerless. It means you have a purpose now.”

Jax looked down at the watch again, its surface now cold and unyielding. He had spent so long trying to forget, to escape, but now he realized that the echoes weren’t just memories—they were *warnings*. A reminder of what was at stake.

He met Kael’s gaze, and for the first time in years, he felt something stir within him—not guilt, not fear, but a flicker of hope. A possibility that maybe, just maybe, he could still change things.

But not without understanding them first.

**Scene Number: 2 – The Back Room Reveal**

Kael led Jax through the narrow passage behind the counter, the air growing heavier as they stepped into the back room. It was a place of secrets, where time bent and twisted in ways that defied logic. Shelves lined the walls, each one holding artifacts from different eras—some ancient, some futuristic, and many that didn’t belong to any single timeline at all.

The room pulsed with an energy that made Jax’s skin prickle. It wasn’t just the presence of temporal devices; it was the *weight* of history pressing down on them. Every object here had a story, and every story had been altered, erased, or rewritten by someone else.

Kael gestured to a table at the center of the room, where a collection of ancient instruments sat in a circle. One of them was a device that looked like a cross between a compass and a clock, its face cracked and its hands frozen in place. Another was a small, silver sphere that pulsed with an internal light, as if it were breathing.

“This is where we’ve been working,” Kael said, his voice low. “We’ve been trying to piece together what happened during the Great Timeline Fracture. The Concord’s records are incomplete, and they’ve gone to great lengths to suppress the truth.”

Jax looked around, his mind racing. “You think it was someone from the Concord who caused it?”

Kael nodded. “Yes. And we believe that someone is still out there, trying to rewrite history in their own image. That’s why Cohort Zero is doing this now—they’re pruning minor timelines, but they’re also preparing for something bigger.”

Jax clenched his jaw. “And you think I can help with that?”

Kael turned to face him fully, his expression serious. “You were the first person to see what they were doing. You were the only one who could perceive the fractures before they became catastrophic. That’s why they targeted you. Because you *knew*.”

Jax felt a wave of anger rise in him, but he quickly smothered it. ...hat had been forced upon him. He stood in a dimly lit room, surrounded by flickering holograms of people who looked like they were caught in a storm of time. One of them was Lila, her face familiar yet distant, as though he had only seen it in a dream.

She turned to him, her eyes wide with fear. “Jax, you have to stop them.”

He didn’t understand. “Who?”

“The ones who are trying to erase the truth,” she said, her voice trembling. “They don’t want anyone to remember what happened. Not even *you*.”

The echo shifted again, and Jax found himself standing in a different moment—one where he had failed to stop a timeline from fracturing. He had been there, in that room, but he didn’t remember how he got there. The scene was too vivid, too real, as though it were happening now.

He met Kael’s gaze, and for the first time in years, he felt something stir within him—not guilt, not fear, but a flicker of hope. A possibility that maybe, just maybe, he could still change things.

But not without understanding them first.

“I can’t change what’s already happened,” he said, his voice barely audible. “I can only remember.”

Kael met his gaze with something that felt like understanding. “Then let’s start remembering. Together.” And even then, I couldn’t stop them.”

Kael’s eyes softened. “You didn’t have to. The fracture wasn’t just about one event—it was about *you*. About your ability to see what others couldn’t. That’s why they let it happen. To test you. To see if you would resist their influence.”

Jax stared at him, his mind reeling. He had always believed the fracture was an accident, a mistake he couldn’t undo. But now, the idea that it had been *intentional* felt like a blade cutting through his carefully constructed illusions.

“They let it happen,” Jax repeated, his voice barely audible. “So they could see if I would resist.”

Kael nodded again. “Exactly. And you did. You didn’t let them erase everything. You saw the truth, even when they tried to make you forget it.”

Jax looked away, his hands trembling. “I don’t even remember what happened.”

Kael’s voice was gentle now. “That’s because the echoes are only fragments. They’re not meant to be fully understood. But you *can* understand them. You just have to let yourself see.”

Jax exhaled sharply, his thoughts a storm of questions and doubts. He had spent years trying to escape the past, to forget the faces that had vanished in the fracture. But now, he realized that forgetting wasn’t an option. Not anymore.

“I can’t change what’s already happened,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “I can only remember.”

Kael met his gaze with something that felt like understanding. “Then let’s start remembering. Together.”

Jax hesitated for a moment, then nodded slowly. “Alright. But I need to know the truth. All of it.”

Kael smiled faintly. “You’ll get it. Just not yet.”

**Scene Number: 3 – The Echo of Failure**

The shop was quiet now, the only sound the occasional creak of the floorboards or the distant hum of a device in the back room. Jax sat in the shop’s quietest corner, where time seemed to stretch and memories flickered like candlelight.

He had been here for years, trying to forget. But the echoes had always found him, no matter how hard he tried to block them out. They came in fragments—flickers of people he had failed to save, moments that had slipped through his fingers like sand.

Now, they were coming *stronger*.

He closed his eyes and let the memories flood in. The first one was clear: a city in flames, its people screaming as time unraveled around them. He had been there, just outside the chaos, watching helplessly as the timeline collapsed. He had tried to stop it, but he hadn’t been fast enough.

The next memory was of Lila, her face twisted with fear as she looked at him. “Jax, you have to stop them,” she had said, her voice breaking. ---

The next memory was of Lila, her face twisted with fear as she looked at him. “Jax, you have to stop them,” she had said, her voice breaking. “You’re the only one who can see what they’re doing.”

He had tried to reach for her, but the echo pulled away before he could touch her. He didn’t remember how he got there, or why he hadn’t been able to save her. But the memory was clear now—she had been *part* of the fracture, not just a victim.

His hands trembled as he sat up, his breath coming in short gasps. The shop felt colder, heavier, as though the weight of the past had finally settled on him.

“I didn’t save them,” he whispered, more to himself than anyone else. “I let them die.”

The words felt like a curse, something he couldn’t undo. He had always believed that time was a river, and that once it passed, it couldn’t be changed. But now, he realized that time wasn’t just a river—it was a battlefield. And he was the only one who could see the war unfolding.

He looked up at the ceiling, where the flickering lanterns cast long shadows across the walls. He had spent so long running from his past, from the guilt that clung to him like a shadow, but now he saw that he couldn’t run anymore.

The echoes were his only guide, his only truth. And they were telling him that he had to face what he had done.He had tried to reach for her, but the echo pulled away before he could touch her. He didn’t remember how he got there, or why he hadn’t been able to save her. But the memory was clear now—she had been *part* of the fracture, not just a victim.

His hands trembled as he sat up, his breath coming in short gasps. The shop felt colder, heavier, as though the weight of the past had finally settled on him.

He looked around the room, taking in the dust and silence, the scent of old paper and ozone. It had always been a place of refuge, but now it felt like a prison. He had spent so long trying to escape the echoes, to forget what he had done, that he hadn’t realized they were *part* of him.

“I didn’t save them,” he whispered, more to himself than anyone else. “I let them die.”

The words felt like a curse, something he couldn’t undo. He had always believed that time was a river, and that once it passed, it couldn’t be changed. But now, he realized that time wasn’t just a river—it was a battlefield. And he was the only one who could see the war unfolding.

He looked up at the ceiling, where the flickering lanterns cast long shadows across the walls. He had spent so long running from his past, from the guilt that clung to him like a shadow, but now he saw that he couldn’t run anymore.

The echoes were his only guide, his only truth. And they were telling him that he had to face what he had done.

“I can see the echoes,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “But I can’t change them. Only watch.”

Kael’s voice came from behind him, calm and steady. “That’s all you need to do, Jax. You don’t have to change anything. Just *understand* it.”

Jax turned to face him, his expression unreadable. “And what if I can’t understand it?”

Kael stepped closer, his voice low. “Then we’ll help you. We’ve been waiting for someone like you. Someone who can see the fractures before they become disasters.”

Jax looked at him for a long moment, his mind racing. He had spent so long trying to forget, to escape, but now he saw that the only way forward was through the echoes.

“I don’t know if I’m ready,” he admitted, his voice thick with uncertainty.

Kael’s smile was faint, but it held something like hope. “You never were. But you’re here anyway.”

Jax exhaled slowly, his shoulders sagging as he let the weight of the moment settle on him. He had been a target for so long, a ghost in the multiverse, but now he realized that he was *more* than that. He was a witness to history, a keeper of truths that others tried to erase.

He looked down at his hands, still trembling from the memory. “I don’t want to remember.”

Kael’s voice was steady. “You have to. Because if you don’t, they’ll keep coming. And this time, they won’t let you escape.”

Jax nodded slowly, the decision settling in his chest like a stone. He had spent years running from the past, but now he saw that the only way to truly move forward was to face it.

And so, with the echoes still whispering in his mind, Jax Xenobia took his first step toward understanding the truth.
