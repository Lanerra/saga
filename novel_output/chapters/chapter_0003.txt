Kaelen moved through the dim corridors of the archive with measured steps, each footfall echoing faintly against the stone walls. The air was thick with dust and the scent of old parchment, a musty perfume that clung to his robes. Lanterns flickered along the narrow passageways, their light casting long shadows that seemed to shift when he wasn’t looking. He had come here seeking answers—answers that others seemed determined to keep buried.

Archivist Maelis sat at a desk near the entrance, hunched over a stack of brittle tomes. Her face was lined with age and something more—something Kaelen couldn’t quite name. When she looked up, her eyes were sharp, but there was an unease in them, like she had seen too much and was afraid to speak of it.

“You shouldn’t be asking about that,” she said without preamble, her voice low and taut.

Kaelen hesitated, then stepped closer. “I need to know. The dream-echo—it’s real, isn’t it? It’s not just a myth.”

Maelis didn’t answer immediately. She turned back to her work, but the silence between them was heavy. Kaelen could feel the weight of it pressing against his chest, like an unspoken truth that had been sealed away for too long.

“You’re not the first to ask,” she said finally, her fingers tracing the edge of a book. “But none of them are here anymore.”

A chill ran down Kaelen’s spine. “What happened to them?”

Maelis looked up again, and for the first time, he saw fear in her eyes. “We’ve seen too much. We don’t speak of it anymore.”

Kaelen swallowed hard. He had expected resistance, but not this. Not this silence, this refusal to acknowledge the truth. “What happens if we remember?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Maelis’s expression hardened. “You don’t want to know.”

The words hung between them like a curse. Kaelen felt the weight of them settle in his gut, but he couldn’t turn back now. He had come too far. “I need to see the records,” he said, more firmly this time.

Maelis shook her head. “You don’t understand. This isn’t just about knowledge. It’s about survival.”

Kaelen reached for the nearest book on the desk, but Maelis stopped him with a hand on his wrist. Her grip was surprisingly strong, and for a moment, he thought she might pull him back. But then she let go, her expression softening.

“Be careful,” she said. “Some truths are better left forgotten.”

Kaelen nodded, though the words did little to ease the unease curling in his stomach. He moved deeper into the archive, past rows of towering shelves and shadowed alcoves where scribes hunched over their work, their faces pale and drawn. They didn’t look up as he passed, but he could feel their eyes on him, watching, waiting.

He found a small chamber tucked behind a row of tomes, its entrance barely visible. The air inside was colder, the scent of ancient ink and decay more pronounced. A single lantern flickered on the far wall, casting long, wavering shadows across the stone floor.

Kaelen stepped inside, his breath shallow. The walls were lined with shelves, each filled with books bound in leather that had turned brittle with age. He ran his fingers along the spines, feeling the rough texture beneath his touch. Most of them were blank, their pages untouched, but a few bore faded inscriptions—names, dates, titles he didn’t recognize.

He pulled one down and opened it carefully. The pages were yellowed, the ink faded, but the words were still legible. *The Dream-Echo: A Record of the Unseen.* He turned the page, his heart pounding. The text spoke of a phenomenon that had plagued the city for centuries, a force that lured people into its depths, altering their minds and leaving them hollow-eyed and broken. It described how those who fell under its influence would speak in riddles, their words filled with strange, shifting meanings. Some disappeared entirely, lost to the labyrinth of dreams.

Kaelen’s hands trembled as he turned another page. The record grew darker, more desperate. It spoke of a time when the dream-echo had been a tool of knowledge, used by the city’s architects to explore the boundaries of reality. But something had changed. The echoes had become sentient, feeding on the very truths they revealed. Those who sought them out were never the same again.

He closed the book with a shudder. This was more than he had expected. More than he had been prepared for. He had thought he was searching for answers, but now he wondered if he was simply walking into a trap of his own making.

A noise echoed from the corridor outside—the faintest creak of a door opening. Kaelen froze, heart hammering in his chest. He turned toward the entrance, his breath catching as he saw a figure standing in the doorway.

It was another scribe, but this one looked different—older, more worn. His eyes were sunken, his face gaunt. He didn’t speak, but Kaelen could see the fear in his gaze. It was the same fear he had seen in Maelis’s eyes.

Kaelen took a step back, but the scribe raised a hand, gesturing for him to stay. Then, without a word, he turned and disappeared into the shadows.

Kaelen exhaled slowly, forcing himself to move. He couldn’t afford to be caught here. Not now. He replaced the book and left the chamber, his mind racing with questions. The dream-echo wasn’t just a myth—it was real, and it was spreading.

He needed to find Lira. She would know what to do. But as he stepped back into the main archive, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he had already been seen, that the echoes were watching him now.

---

Kaelen found Lira in her study, a secluded space filled with scrolls and half-burned notes. The scent of ink and old paper hung in the air, mingling with the faint smoke from a dying fire. She sat at a desk, her fingers tracing the edges of a parchment, her expression pensive.

She looked up when he entered, her eyes sharp with concern. “You found something,” she said, more statement than question.

Kaelen nodded, his voice tight. “I saw the records. The dream-echo—it’s not just a force. It’s a hazard. A memetic one.”

Lira’s expression darkened. “You shouldn’t have gone there.”

“I didn’t have a choice,” Kaelen replied. “It’s spreading. People are disappearing, and I don’t think it’s just the echoes anymore. They’re changing people.”

Lira stood, pacing slowly. “It doesn’t just corrupt minds—it changes them at the core. Every truth we uncover becomes a seed for the echo. You can’t stop it by finding more of it.”

Kaelen stepped closer, his voice low. “Then what do I do? If I stop searching, I’ll never know the whole truth.”

Lira’s gaze met his, and for a moment, he saw something in her eyes—fear, but also something else. Resignation. “You must stop searching, Kaelen. Or you’ll become one of them.”

The words hit him like a blow. He had always thought of himself as different, as someone who could see the truth without being consumed by it. But now, he wasn’t sure.

“What if I can’t?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Lira’s expression softened, but her eyes remained hard. “Then you’ll be lost, just like the others.”

Kaelen looked away, his mind churning with doubt. He had spent his life as an observer, a mediator, someone who saw both sides of every conflict. But this was different. This wasn’t about balance—it was about survival.

He turned back to Lira. “If I stop, what happens? If I don’t try to understand it?”

Lira hesitated, then sighed. “The dream-echo will continue to spread. And eventually, it will consume the city.”

Kaelen’s stomach twisted. He had always believed in knowledge, in the power of truth to illuminate the darkness. But now, he wasn’t sure if the truth was worth the cost.

“I don’t know if I can stop,” he said finally.

Lira studied him for a long moment, then nodded. “Then you must be careful. Because if you keep searching, you won’t be the same when you find it.”

---

The streets of Thal’Zirath were quieter than usual, the air heavy with an unspoken tension. Kaelen moved through the lower districts, his mind still reeling from Lira’s warning. He had expected resistance, but not this—this feeling that he was walking a tightrope, one misstep away from falling into the abyss.

He didn’t expect to see Dain.

The man stood at the edge of a crumbling street, his back to Kaelen. His form was gaunt, his clothes tattered, and his eyes—Kaelen’s breath caught in his throat. They were hollow, empty, like they had been drained of everything that made him who he was.

“Dain,” Kaelen said, stepping forward cautiously.

Dain turned slowly, his expression unreadable. “You’ve come back,” he said, his voice distant, almost dreamlike.

Kaelen’s heart pounded. “What happened to you?”

Dain smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “I saw the truth.”

Kaelen took another step closer. “What truth?”

Dain tilted his head, as if considering the question. “The Sleeper is waking… and it’s beautiful.”

Kaelen felt a chill crawl up his spine. “You’re not yourself.”

Dain laughed softly. “We’re not lost—we’re becoming something more.”

Kaelen’s hands clenched into fists. “This isn’t becoming. This is losing.”

Dain stepped closer, his gaze piercing. “Why do you still fear what you can’t control?”

Kaelen swallowed hard, the weight of the question settling in his chest. He had always believed that knowledge was power. But now, he wasn’t sure.

“I don’t want to lose myself,” he admitted.

Dain’s expression softened, just slightly. “Then you’re still human.”

The words sent a shiver through Kaelen. He reached out, but Dain stepped back, his eyes gleaming with something unnatural.

“You should go,” Dain said, his voice quieter now. “Before you see too much.”

Kaelen hesitated, then turned and walked away, his heart heavy. He had known Dain once—had trusted him, laughed with him. But now, he was a stranger, a shadow of the man he had been.

He kept walking, the weight of Dain’s words pressing against his chest. The dream-echo wasn’t just changing people—it was erasing them.

---

The Thoughtstorms were deeper than Kaelen had imagined. He had heard whispers of them before, but no one had ever spoken of their true nature. Now, as he moved through the hidden chamber beneath Thal’Zirath, he could feel the weight of history pressing in around him.

The air was thick with a strange energy, like the very fabric of the city was shifting beneath his feet. The walls were lined with ancient tablets, their inscriptions glowing faintly, as if they held memories that refused to be forgotten. A single crystal hovered in the center of the chamber, its light pulsing like a heartbeat.

Kaelen approached it cautiously, his breath shallow. He had read about these places in the records—spaces where the city’s architects and dream-weavers gathered to maintain its delicate balance. But this place felt different. More dangerous.

He reached for the crystal, but as his fingers brushed against it, a rush of images flooded his mind. Faces, voices, fragments of dreams that weren’t his. He staggered back, gasping.

The journal was here—somewhere in the chamber. He had to find it.

He moved deeper into the room, his steps careful, his senses heightened. The air grew colder, the light from the crystal dimming as he approached a hidden alcove. A single book rested on a pedestal, its cover worn and cracked.

Kaelen reached for it, his hands trembling. The moment he touched it, a surge of energy coursed through him, and the world around him shifted.

He was no longer in the chamber. He was standing in a city that wasn’t Thal’Zirath, a place where the sky was fractured and the streets twisted in impossible directions. The people here moved like ghosts, their eyes empty, their voices echoing with strange, shifting words.

Kaelen’s breath came in short, shallow gasps. This was the dream-echo—his own reflection, distorted and broken.

He turned, and there, standing at the edge of the city, was a figure he recognized. It was a scribe from the archive, one who had disappeared years ago. But now, they looked different—older, more hollow, their expression unreadable.

“Why are you here?” Kaelen asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

The figure tilted their head. “You came looking for answers.”

Kaelen’s pulse quickened. “What happened to you?”

The figure stepped closer, their voice low and distorted. “I thought I was saving them… but I only gave them the truth.”

Kaelen felt a chill run down his spine. “What truth?”

The figure’s eyes darkened. “The more they knew, the less they were.”

Kaelen took a step back, his mind reeling. He had read about this in the records, but now, it was real. It was happening here, in the depths of Thal’Zirath.

He looked down at the journal in his hands. “I wish I had never opened this book.”

The figure’s expression remained unreadable. “You already have.”

The vision shattered, and Kaelen found himself back in the chamber, gasping for breath. The crystal pulsed once more, then dimmed, as if it had seen enough.

He clutched the journal to his chest, his heart pounding. This was proof of what Lira had warned him about. And now, he had it in his hands.

But the question remained—what would he do with it?

---

Kaelen had barely stepped out of the Thoughtstorms when he felt it—the presence of someone watching him. He turned sharply, his hand instinctively reaching for the hilt of his dagger.

A figure emerged from the shadows, their silhouette sharp against the dim light. They moved with purpose, their steps silent, their gaze unrelenting.

“You should not have gone there,” the figure said, their voice low and measured.

Kaelen’s grip on his dagger tightened. “Who are you?”

The figure stepped forward, revealing themselves as a man in dark robes, their face obscured by a hood. “I am Agent Varis of the Erebus Order.”

Kaelen’s breath caught. He had heard of them before—whispers of a secretive group that once guarded knowledge about the dream-echo and Thal’Zirath. But no one spoke of them openly, and certainly not in the streets.

“You don’t belong here,” Varis continued. “You think you’re fighting for knowledge, but you’re spreading a plague.”

Kaelen’s jaw tightened. “I’m trying to stop it.”

Varis tilted his head slightly. “And what do you think will happen when you reveal the truth? You’ll destroy everything this city was built on.”

Kaelen shook his head. “You don’t understand. The dream-echo isn’t just a force—it’s a hazard. It’s changing people, erasing them. If we don’t act, it will consume us all.”

Varis’s expression remained unreadable. “Some truths are not meant to be spoken.”

Kaelen took a step forward. “And what if the truth is worth it?”

Varis’s gaze sharpened. “Then you will become what you fear most.”

The words hung between them, heavy with meaning. Kaelen felt the weight of them settle in his chest, but he didn’t back down.

“I won’t stop,” he said, his voice steady. “I won’t let this city fall to something I can’t control.”

Varis studied him for a long moment, then turned away. “Then you will be lost,” they said, their voice almost a whisper. “Just like the others.”

Kaelen watched as they disappeared into the shadows, their presence lingering like a ghost.

He looked down at the journal in his hands, its pages filled with the truth he had sought. And for the first time, he wondered if Lira had been right all along.

Some truths were too dangerous to know.

---

The chamber was quiet, save for the soft hum of the crystal that pulsed with a faint, rhythmic light. Kaelen sat cross-legged on the cold stone floor, the journal open in his lap. He had read it cover to cover, each page filled with desperate warnings, fragmented memories, and the echoes of those who had come before him.

The dream-echo wasn’t just a force—it was a trial. A test of knowledge, of will, of sanity. And he had passed the first threshold.

But what came next?

He closed the journal, his hands trembling slightly. He could feel the weight of it in his mind, the truth pressing against his thoughts like a second heartbeat. It wasn’t just knowledge anymore—it was something else. Something deeper.

And then, the vision came.

It started as a flicker in the corner of his vision, a shimmer that didn’t belong to the chamber. Then, the world around him shifted, and he was no longer in the hidden chamber beneath Thal’Zirath. He was standing on the edge of something vast, something impossibly large.

The Sleeper.

It was not a being, not in the way Kaelen had imagined. It was a presence, an awareness that stretched beyond the limits of his perception. Its form was indistinct, shifting like smoke, but its presence was undeniable. It pulsed with a slow, steady rhythm, as if it were breathing.

Kaelen felt himself drawn to it, pulled by something he couldn’t name. The air around him thickened, and for a moment, he forgot who he was. He forgot where he was.

Then, the vision fractured.

He was back in the chamber, gasping for breath. The crystal had dimmed, its light flickering like a dying flame. His hands were shaking, his mind reeling from what he had seen.

What am I becoming? A dreamer or a nightmare?

The question echoed in his mind, and with it came another realization—this wasn’t just about the dream-echo anymore. It was about him. About who he was and who he might become.

He looked down at the journal once more, then closed it gently. He had seen enough. But the truth remained, lingering in the back of his mind like a whisper that wouldn’t be silenced.

The Sleeper was waking.

And Kaelen was no longer sure if he could stop it.

---

Kaelen found Lira waiting for him in her study, her expression more somber than before. She looked up as he entered, her eyes searching his face.

“You saw it,” she said quietly.

Kaelen nodded, the weight of the vision still pressing against his chest. “I saw the Sleeper.”

Lira’s lips pressed into a thin line. “Then you understand now.”

Kaelen sat down across from her, his hands resting on the table. “It wasn’t just a vision. It was real. And it’s waking up.”

Lira exhaled slowly. “They thought they could control it… but it controls us now.”

Kaelen frowned. “Who? The architects of Thal’Zirath?”

Lira nodded. “This is not just a hazard—it’s a trial. One that was meant to test the limits of human knowledge.”

Kaelen felt a chill run down his spine. “And we failed.”

Lira’s gaze was steady, but there was something in her eyes—something like sorrow. “We didn’t just fail. We were never meant to understand it. The dream-echo was never meant to be discovered.”

Kaelen looked away, his mind racing. He had spent his life searching for truth, believing that knowledge was the key to everything. But now, he wasn’t sure.

“What do we do?” he asked finally.

Lira didn’t answer immediately. She looked out the window, her expression distant. “We find a way to stop it. Before it consumes us all.”

Kaelen met her gaze. “And if there’s no way?”

Lira’s lips pressed into a thin line. “Then we become part of it.”

A silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken fears. Kaelen felt the weight of it settle in his chest, but he didn’t look away.

He had come seeking answers. Now, he was facing something far greater.

The dream-echo wasn’t just a force—it was a test. And he was running out of time to pass it.
