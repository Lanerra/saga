The Schoolhouse loomed before them like a skeleton of forgotten days, its windows blackened with grime and its once-proud facade now sagging under the weight of time. Sága stepped through the warped door, her boots echoing in the cavernous silence. The air was thick with dust, carrying the scent of decay and something more elusive—something like memory itself, lingering in the cracks between walls that had long since stopped holding anything but ghosts.

Lir followed closely, his eyes scanning the room with a mixture of apprehension and fascination. The classroom was a graveyard of learning. Desks were splintered and overturned, chalkboards bore only faint smudges of what might have once been lessons, and the overhead lights flickered like a dying heartbeat. Scattered across the floor were remnants of memory orbs—some cracked, others still glowing faintly, as though their contents had not yet been entirely consumed.

“This place is a ghost of what it once was,” Sága murmured, her voice barely louder than the creaking of the floorboards beneath her feet. She ran a hand over the edge of a desk, feeling the grooves where students had once traced letters and numbers, now meaningless to them all.

Lir nodded, his gaze lingering on one of the orbs that lay near a broken chair. “They left it behind,” he said quietly. “Someone tried to remember.”

Sága turned, her eyes narrowing at the sight of the orb. She crouched beside it, brushing away the dust with careful fingers. The glass was thin, almost translucent, and inside pulsed a soft blue light. It wasn’t hers. Not yet. But she could feel it—something within, waiting to be unlocked.

“We can’t turn back now, even if we’re walking into danger,” she said, standing again. Her voice was firm, but her fingers trembled slightly as they curled around the orb. She had spent years surviving by forgetting, by trading away pieces of herself for the promise of more time. But now, something had shifted inside her. Now, she wanted to remember.

They moved deeper into the building, past rows of empty bookshelves and a long, rusted blackboard that had not been cleaned in decades. The silence was oppressive, broken only by the occasional groan of the structure as it settled into its own slow decay. Lir’s breath was shallow, his eyes darting to every shadow, every flicker of light.

In the back of the room, behind a collapsed wall and a tangle of wires, Sága spotted something that hadn’t been there before—a cabinet, old and dented, wedged between two fallen shelves. It was locked, but the rust on the handle suggested it had not been used in years.

Lir reached for it first, though his hands hesitated as they hovered near the metal. “There’s a key,” he said, glancing at Sága. “Or maybe a code.”

Sága didn’t wait. She knelt and pried at the lock with her fingers, then pulled out a small blade from her satchel. The mechanism was ancient, but not unbreakable. With a sharp twist, the lock gave way.

Inside, the cabinet was filled with yellowed paper and broken memory devices—some still humming faintly, others long dead. Sága’s breath caught as she pulled out a ledger, its pages brittle and crumbling at the edges. The ink had faded, but the names were still legible.

She flipped through the pages, her eyes scanning the list of individuals—most with no context, just names and numbers. But then she saw it: *Sága Veyra*. Her name was written in the same precise hand that had signed the documents in the Memory Exchange. Below it, a date—*Cycle 12, Year 743*—and a brief note: *Subject 09-Alpha. Neural signature unique. Experimental phase complete.*

Her throat tightened. She had always known she was different, but this confirmed what she had begun to suspect. She was never just a dealer. She had been part of the Council’s design.

Lir leaned over her shoulder, his voice barely above a whisper. “This name... I’ve heard it before.”

Sága looked up at him, her expression unreadable. “I think we all have,” she said, her fingers tracing the inked letters. “They were experimenting on people like us.”

She turned another page, revealing more names, some of which were familiar—names from the resistance, from the Free Scribes, from the Echoists. Names that should not be here, shouldn’t be cataloged like this.

Lir’s face was pale. “If we share this, will they come after us?”

Sága didn’t answer immediately. She stared at the page, her mind racing. The Council had been using people like her—people who remembered, who resisted, who could be used as tools or test subjects. She had always thought of herself as a survivor, but now she saw the truth: she had been a pawn in their game.

Her fingers tightened around the edge of the paper. “They already know what we’re doing,” she said finally. “We found this place. They sealed it off after the last rebellion.”

Lir swallowed hard. “Then they must be watching.”

The words hung between them, heavy with unspoken fear. Sága stood, her back to the cabinet, and looked around the room as if it might offer some answer. But the classroom had no voice, only echoes of the past.

They were not alone in this.

As they left the cabinet behind, Lir paused, his eyes fixed on a collection of memory orbs stacked on the floor. “These... they’re not all broken,” he said quietly. “Some of them are still active.”

Sága didn’t respond at first. Then she reached down and picked one up, feeling the cool glass in her palm. “We need to know what they took from us,” she said. “Not just mine.”

They moved deeper into the schoolhouse, their footsteps echoing through the halls as if the building itself was listening. Lir’s quiet observation about the orbs had struck something in Sága—something she had been avoiding. The idea that others, perhaps even those she had known, had been taken from her without her knowing it.

But there was no turning back now. Not when the truth was within reach.

In a dimly lit corridor further inside, they found a group of people gathered around a table made from an old desk. Their faces were gaunt, their eyes shadowed with the weight of what they had lost. Sága and Lir froze at the threshold, uncertain whether they were intruders or welcome guests.

One of them stood, a tall man with a scar running down his cheek. He stepped forward, his voice steady but edged with something Sága couldn’t place—anger, maybe, or grief.

“You were one of them,” he said. “We know.”

Sága’s pulse quickened. She looked around at the others, some of whom she recognized from the ledger. There was a woman named Mira, her posture rigid, eyes sharp with intensity. A man called Talo, his face expressionless but his stance defensive.

“We’ve lost everything,” the scarred man continued. “But we still remember.”

Sága’s heart pounded in her chest. She had spent years convincing herself that she was alone in this, that no one else could understand what it felt like to have your past stolen piece by piece. But now, standing before these strangers who claimed to be part of a resistance, she saw the truth reflected in their eyes.

She took a step forward, her voice low. “Who are you?”

The woman named Mira answered. “We’re the ones they tried to erase. The Free Scribes. We’ve been hiding in the shadows, collecting what we can. You have the power to change this, Sága.”

Sága’s hands clenched at her sides. She had heard that name before, whispered in the dark corners of the city, spoken only by those who had nothing left to lose. But now it was real. Now it was here.

She looked at Lir, who stood beside her, watching the group with a mix of fear and curiosity. “I don’t know if I can trust you,” she said. “Not yet.”

The scarred man, who introduced himself as Dain, nodded. “We understand. You’ve been through hell, haven’t you? We all have.”

Sága didn’t answer. She couldn’t. Not yet.

Later that night, in a narrow corridor lit only by the flickering glow of a single bulb, Sága sat with Dain and Mira as they discussed their next move. The tension was palpable, each of them speaking in hushed tones, aware that even here, in the ruins of The Schoolhouse, the Council could be listening.

Mira leaned forward, her voice urgent. “You’re not like the others. You’ve seen what they’ve done. You know how it works.”

Sága looked away, her thoughts a storm within her. She had spent so long surviving by forgetting, by trading away parts of herself for safety. But now, she was being asked to do something else—to fight. To remember.

“I don’t owe you anything,” she said finally. “But I won’t let them erase me.”

Dain’s eyes softened. “That’s all we need.”

Lir sat nearby, tinkering with a memory retrieval unit. He had been helping her since the beginning, but now he was more than an assistant—he was a part of this, whether he wanted to be or not.

Sága didn’t notice him at first. But as the night stretched on and the others spoke in hushed tones about plans and risks, she found herself watching him. He had always been quiet, observant, but now, there was something else in his eyes—something that mirrored her own fear, her own resolve.

She stood abruptly, her voice cutting through the conversation. “We need to move faster. The Council won’t wait forever.”

Mira’s brow furrowed. “You’re not afraid of them anymore?”

Sága looked at her, then at the others. “I was afraid,” she said. “But I don’t want to be afraid. I want to remember.”

She didn’t know if that made her a leader or just another pawn in their game. But as Lir looked up from his work and met her eyes with something like understanding, she felt the first cracks in the wall she had built around herself.

In the days that followed, Lir began to explore the memory orbs more deeply, though Sága watched him closely. She had seen what they could do—how they could unravel a person’s mind if used carelessly. But now, he was asking questions she hadn’t thought to ask.

One evening, in a room that had once been a storeroom and now served as their hideout, Lir found an orb that wasn’t cracked or broken. He held it up to the light, its surface reflecting the dim glow of the single lamp above them.

“This isn’t my memory,” he said slowly. “It’s someone else’s.”

Sága leaned over his shoulder, her breath catching as she saw the flicker within the orb. It was not a fragment of Lir’s past—it was something else. A different life, a different person. The weight of it settled in her chest like a stone.

“What if we’re not just losing our own memories?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. “What if they’re taking from others and using them as... as something else?”

Lir looked at her, his expression unreadable. “Then why did they take yours?”

Sága didn’t answer. She wasn’t sure anymore.

Later that night, alone in her workshop, Lir sat across from her, the orb between them. He had been watching her closely, and now he spoke with quiet intensity.

“You have to see it,” he said. “You were never just a test subject. You were something else.”

She didn’t want to. She had spent so long trying to forget that she feared what she might remember. But Lir’s voice was steady, and for the first time, she felt something in him—understanding, not fear.

She reached out and took the orb from his hands.

Dr. Veyra found her in the hidden chamber beneath The Schoolhouse. It was a place that had once been used for experiments, now abandoned and filled with the remnants of devices that had once extracted thoughts from living minds. The air was thick with the scent of ozone, and the walls were lined with old containment cells, their metal doors rusted shut.

Sága had not expected to see her again. Not after everything she had done, everything she had become.

“You have a unique neural signature,” Dr. Veyra said, her voice calm but laced with something Sága couldn’t name—perhaps regret, or perhaps the thrill of control. “You’re invaluable.”

Sága’s hands curled into fists. “I don’t trust you. You took everything from me.”

Dr. Veyra tilted her head slightly. “This isn’t about power... it’s about survival.”

But Sága knew better. She had seen what the Council did to those who resisted. She had seen the hollow-eyed survivors, the ones who had traded too much and now lived with nothing but a numb certainty that they were alive.

She turned away from the woman, her voice sharp. “I don’t want to be your weapon again.”

Dr. Veyra’s expression didn’t change. “Then you’ll have to stay here,” she said. “Because I can’t let you go freely.”

Sága felt the weight of the words settle in her chest. She had thought she was running from the Council, but now she realized she might be running toward them.

She left the chamber quickly, her pulse hammering against her ribs. But when she reached the corridor, Dain was waiting for her.

“I lost my daughter because I forgot her,” he said quietly. “I didn’t want to. I tried not to. But I did.”

Sága’s breath caught. She had never heard a resistance leader speak like this—like someone who had once been just another citizen, another victim of the system.

“What if we can stop this before it’s too late?” Dain asked, his voice steady but laced with something raw and unfiltered. “What if we can find a way to remember without losing ourselves?”

She looked at him, then at Dr. Veyra’s warning still echoing in her mind. She knew the risks. But she also knew that if she turned away now, she would never be able to face what had been taken from her.

“I’ll stay,” she said finally. “But I won’t help them. Not again.”

Dain nodded. “Then we fight for those who can’t.”

Their group gathered in the basement of The Schoolhouse, the air thick with the weight of their choices. Maps were spread across the table, memory orbs lined up like relics, and the tension between Mira and Talo was palpable.

Mira’s voice was sharp, urgent. “We can’t wait forever. They’re already taking more memories. If we don’t act now, they’ll take everything.”

Talo, ever the pragmatist, shook his head. “If we strike too soon, they’ll crush us. We need evidence. Proof of what they’re doing.”

Sága watched them both, her mind a battlefield of conflicting thoughts. She had spent so long surviving on instinct, on self-preservation, but now she found herself caught between two paths—one that would lead to safety and the other to something greater.

She finally spoke, her voice low but firm. “We move forward with a plan.”

Mira’s eyes lit up with determination, while Talo frowned slightly, not entirely convinced. But Sága had made her choice.

Later, in a forgotten storage room filled with sealed memory orbs, she found one that was different from the rest. It was older, its glass more cracked than broken, but the light within still pulsed faintly. She reached for it, hesitating only a moment before opening the seal.

Inside, she saw her mother—standing in the same room, holding her hand as if trying to steady her. The memory was not clear at first, just fragments of sound and shadow. But then, slowly, it came into focus: her mother’s face, pale but resolute, her voice trembling with something Sága couldn’t name.

“I didn’t have to do this,” her mother whispered. “But I did.”

Sága gasped, the memory crashing into her like a wave. She saw the room dissolve around them, replaced by the sterile glow of the Memory Exchange. Her mother stood before a device, her eyes filled with something that was neither fear nor regret—it was resignation.

“I did this for you,” she said again, and then the memory faded, leaving Sága gasping in the dark.

Lir found her there, kneeling on the floor, staring at the orb with wide eyes. He didn’t say anything, just sat beside her, his presence a quiet reassurance.

“We can’t let her sacrifice be in vain,” she said, her voice thick with emotion. “I won’t let it be.”

Lir looked at her then, and for the first time, she saw something in him that wasn’t just concern or loyalty—it was understanding. A recognition of what she had lost, and what he might one day lose as well.

In the days that followed, Sága trained with Lir in the converted lab room of The Schoolhouse, surrounded by flickering holograms and outdated memory interfaces. It was grueling work, her mind stretched to its limits as she tried to access and manipulate memories that were not hers.

“You have to trust your own mind if you want to fight them,” Lir said one evening, his voice steady despite the exhaustion etched into his face.

She looked at him then, her eyes searching. “What if I lose myself in the process?”

Lir didn’t hesitate. “Then we’ll find you again.”

It was a promise she wasn’t sure she could believe, but it was enough to keep going. She had spent so long trying to forget, and now she was learning how to remember.

The Client’s message came through a memory orb that Mira had recovered from the outskirts of Virellis. It was placed in front of Sága in her workshop, its light pulsing gently as if it were alive.

“You think you’re fighting them?” the voice inside the orb said, calm and knowing. “You’re walking into their trap.”

Sága’s hands trembled slightly as she reached for the orb. She had always thought of The Client as a manipulator, someone who played both sides to ensure his own survival. But now, there was something else in his words—something that suggested he might have known more than he let on.

“I’ve seen what they do to those who resist,” the voice continued. “It’s worse than you can imagine.”

She sat back, her mind spinning. Was The Client an enemy? An ally? She had no way of knowing. But she did know one thing: she could no longer afford to believe anyone completely.

Still, when the time came to act, when the group needed a plan and a path forward, it was Sága who stood at the center of it all.

“You’re the only one who can get past the neural locks,” Dain said, his voice firm. “You’ve been inside their system before.”

Sága’s jaw tightened. “I don’t want to be used as a weapon again.”

Mira stepped forward then, her eyes filled with quiet determination. “Then lead us with something else. With purpose.”

Sága looked at them all—Dain, Mira, Lir, Talo—and felt the weight of what they were asking of her. She had always thought of herself as a survivor, someone who would do anything to stay alive. But now, she saw that survival was not the same as living.

She nodded slowly. “I won’t run anymore. I’ll fight for what we’ve lost.”

And with that, she took the memory orb from Lir’s hands, her fingers curling around it like a promise. The rebellion had found its leader, even if she hadn’t known it yet.

But Sága did. And so did the world.
