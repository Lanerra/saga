Jax Xenobia had spent years running from the echoes. They were not just memories, but ripples across time—fragments of moments that should not have happened, yet did. He had tried to bury them in the quiet of his Shop, where time moved slower and guilt could be quieted with silence. But now, standing in the heart of the abandoned Concord research facility, he knew that silence was no longer an option.

The control room hummed with the weight of forgotten machinery. Holographic displays flickered like dying stars, casting long shadows across the cold metal floor. Jax’s hands trembled as they hovered over a console, fingers brushing against its surface like a man afraid to touch something he once knew intimately. The air was thick with static, the kind that made your skin prickle and your thoughts scatter like dust in a draft.

Dr. Varen Kael had been here for hours, poring over data streams and blueprints, his brow furrowed in concentration. Beside him, Professor Sera Lin stood with her back to the door, clutching a data crystal like it was the only thing keeping her grounded. The silence between them was heavy, filled with unspoken fears.

Then, the alarm.

A low, resonant tone that vibrated through the walls like an approaching storm. Jax’s breath caught in his throat as he turned toward the sound, his pulse quickening. It was the same alarm that had signaled the Great Timeline Fracture, the moment everything changed. He had heard it before—years ago, during the mission that had unraveled everything. The same sound that had led to the loss of Lila.

“*We’ve been found. This isn’t over.*” Dr. Kael’s voice was calm but edged with urgency. His fingers flew across the console, trying to shut down the system, but the machinery had already begun to pulse with an ominous energy.

Professor Lin’s eyes darted toward the door. “They think they can erase what we’ve uncovered,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “But they don’t understand—*the truth can’t be erased.*”

Jax didn’t respond. His mind was elsewhere, somewhere he couldn’t reach. He had always known this moment would come. The question was whether he’d be ready for it.

The doors burst open with a deafening clang, and the Cohort Zero agents flooded in. They weren’t like regular enforcers—no uniform, no weapons. Their forms shimmered and shifted, as if made of liquid light, their faces indistinct, their presence more felt than seen. The air around them crackled with an energy that made Jax’s chest tighten.

Dr. Kael cursed under his breath, already moving to the side panel where he had hidden a small device. “We need to move—*now.*”

Professor Lin grabbed his arm, her grip firm. “Jax, we’re trapped. *Use it!*”

His jaw tightened. Use what? The thing that had haunted him for years—the power he had tried so hard to forget. He had once been a temporal agent, trained to manipulate time with precision and control. Now, he was just a man who had lost everything.

He didn’t move. His feet felt rooted to the floor, as if the very ground beneath him had rejected his presence.

“*Jax!*” Dr. Kael’s voice cut through the haze. “We don’t have time for this. If they find us here, they’ll take everything—your memories, your power, your *life.*”

Jax looked at them, his mind a storm of conflicting emotions. He had spent so long running from it, but now the echoes were everywhere, and he couldn’t escape them.

---

The maintenance corridor was dark, lit only by the flickering glow of old machinery. Jax ran, his boots echoing against the metal floor, his breath coming in ragged gasps. Dr. Kael and Professor Lin followed closely behind, their movements precise but hurried. The agents were fast, their forms shifting and reforming as they pursued them through the labyrinthine halls.

Jax’s mind was a storm of images—some familiar, others foreign. He saw himself standing at the edge of a timeline, his hands outstretched as it unraveled before him. He saw Lila, her face twisted in pain, the last moments of her life flashing before his eyes. He saw the fracture itself, a jagged tear in reality that had split the world into countless possibilities.

“*What is that?*” Dr. Kael asked, this time as they rounded a corner and came face to face with an agent blocking their path.

Jax didn’t answer. His mouth was dry, his thoughts too tangled. The echoes were growing stronger now, like a tide pulling him under.

Professor Lin reached out, her hand brushing against his shoulder. “It’s the past,” she said softly. “It’s showing you what happened.”

He nodded, but his eyes remained locked on the agent. Their presence was overwhelming, their energy pressing against his mind like a weight. He could feel them trying to suppress the echoes, to silence the truth.

“I can’t,” he whispered, barely audible over the rising tension in the room.

Dr. Kael’s expression was grim. “Then you will have to learn.”

Professor Lin’s eyes were filled with something close to hope. “You’re not alone in this, Jax. We’ll help you.”

Jax felt the weight of the past pressing against him, but now he was ready to face it. He had spent so long running from it, but now he realized that the only way to move forward was to *confront* it.

He reached out again, this time with purpose. The echoes surged around him, and for a moment, he felt like he was being pulled into a different reality—one where the fracture hadn’t happened, where Lila was still alive, where the world had not been torn apart by his failure.

But then, the agents appeared again, their forms flickering like static on a broken television. Jax’s breath caught in his throat as they advanced, their presence pressing against the echoes, trying to suppress them.

He could feel them trying to erase the truth, to silence him. But he wasn’t going to let that happen.

With a final push of his will, he unleashed the full force of the echoes, sending them spiraling outward like a storm. The corridor was filled with light and shadow, with the truth of what had happened.

And for the first time in years, Jax felt something stir within him—not fear, not guilt, but *purpose.*

---

The chamber was unlike anything Jax had ever seen. The walls were made of shifting temporal fabric, a material that seemed to breathe and pulse with an energy that defied understanding. Data shards floated in the air, some glowing faintly, others flickering like dying stars. The atmosphere was thick with tension, as if the room itself was holding its breath.

Dr. Kael and Professor Lin moved quickly, scanning the room for a way out. But Jax stopped them, his eyes locked on the center of the chamber where a strange vortex of light and shadow coiled like a serpent.

“*We’re trapped,*” Dr. Kael said, his voice low and urgent. “There’s no escape.”

Professor Lin nodded. “This is it. The source of the echoes.”

Jax felt something stir within him. The power he had tried to forget was here, waiting. He could feel it in his bones, in his very being. It was a part of him now, like a second heartbeat.

He stepped forward, his hands trembling. “I don’t know how to use this,” he said.

Dr. Kael’s eyes were serious. “Then you’ll have to learn.”

Professor Lin reached out again, her fingers brushing against his arm. “You’re not just a man who failed—you’re the only one who can stop it.”

Jax looked at them, his mind still reeling from the echoes. He had spent so long running from this moment, but now he realized that the past was not something to be buried—it was something to be faced.

He took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. Then, with a steady hand, he reached out toward the vortex.

The moment his fingers touched it, the world around him shifted.

---

Jax’s vision blurred as he was pulled into the echoes. He saw himself standing at the edge of the fracture, his hands outstretched as it unraveled before him. He saw Lila, her face twisted in pain, the last moments of her life flashing before his eyes. He saw the consequences of their actions, the ripple effects that had spread across time.

And then he saw *himself*—not as a man who had failed, but as someone who had made a choice. A choice to *remember.*

He saw the moment he had first realized the fracture was not an accident. He had seen the patterns, the anomalies, the signs that something was wrong. But instead of acting, he had chosen to hide, to forget.

And now, that choice was coming back to haunt him.

Jax gasped as the echoes pressed against him, demanding to be acknowledged. He could feel them in his chest, in his mind, in every fiber of his being. They weren’t just memories—they were *warnings.*

He opened his eyes and looked at Dr. Kael and Professor Lin. “I remember now,” he said, his voice steady.

Dr. Kael’s eyes widened. “What did you see?”

Jax took a deep breath. “The fracture wasn’t an accident. Someone *intentionally* caused it. And I was part of it.”

Professor Lin stepped forward, her expression unreadable. “You were the one who failed, Jax. But now you have the power to fix it.”

Jax shook his head. “I don’t know how. I’ve never been able to control this power before.”

Dr. Kael’s voice was quiet. “Then you’ll have to learn as you go.”

Professor Lin’s eyes were filled with something close to hope. “You’re not alone in this, Jax. We’ll help you.”

Jax looked at them, his mind still reeling from the echoes. He had spent so long running from the past, but now he realized that the only way to move forward was to *confront* it.

He reached out again, this time with purpose. The echoes surged around him, and for a moment, he felt like he was being pulled into a different reality—one where the fracture hadn’t happened, where Lila was still alive, where the world had not been torn apart by his failure.

But then, the agents appeared again, their forms flickering like static on a broken television. Jax’s breath caught in his throat as they advanced, their presence pressing against the echoes, trying to suppress them.

He could feel them trying to erase the truth, to silence him. But he wasn’t going to let that happen.

With a final push of his will, he unleashed the full force of the echoes, sending them spiraling outward like a storm. The chamber was filled with light and shadow, with the truth of what had happened.

And for the first time in years, Jax felt something close to *peace.*

---

The agents were closing in now, their forms flickering like static on a broken television. Jax could feel the pressure of their presence, the weight of their intent. But he wasn’t going to let them take it from him.

He looked at Dr. Kael and Professor Lin, their faces filled with determination. They were here to help him, to stop the agents before they could erase everything.

Jax took a deep breath and stepped forward. “I won’t let them take this from me,” he said.

Dr. Kael’s expression was grim. “Then we have to stop them before it’s too late.”

Professor Lin’s eyes were filled with something close to hope. “You’re not alone in this, Jax. We’ll help you.”

Jax felt the weight of the past pressing against him, but now he was ready to face it. He had spent so long running from it, but now he realized that the only way to move forward was to *confront* it.

The echoes continued to swirl around him, each one revealing more about the fracture, about the people who had been lost, about the choices he had made. He could feel them pressing against his mind, demanding to be acknowledged. But he wasn’t going to let them take it from him.

He looked at Dr. Kael and Professor Lin, their faces filled with determination. They were here to help him, to stop the agents before they could erase everything.

The chamber’s walls were shifting, pulsing with an energy that defied logic. Time itself seemed to bend and stretch around them, as if the room were a living thing, aware of their presence. Data shards floated in the air, each one a fragment of a moment that had been altered, twisted by the hands of those who sought to control history.

Dr. Kael and Professor Lin moved quickly, scanning for an exit. But Jax stopped them again, this time with more clarity. “This is it,” he said, his voice steady. “The source of the echoes.”

Professor Lin’s eyes locked onto him. “You’ve seen what they’re doing, haven’t you?”

Jax nodded. “They’re not just trying to erase the truth. They’re trying to *redefine* it. To rewrite history so that the fracture never happened.”

Dr. Kael’s expression darkened. “And you were part of that. You saw it, didn’t you? The signs. The patterns. The way the fracture was caused by someone within the Concord—someone who wanted to erase the past and create a new one.”

Jax turned away, his fingers tightening around the air as if grasping for something he could not name. “I remember now,” he said. “The fracture wasn’t an accident. Someone *intentionally* caused it. And I was part of it.”

Professor Lin’s voice was quiet, almost reverent. “You were the one who failed, Jax. But now you have the power to stop them.”

Jax looked at them, his mind still reeling from the echoes. He had spent so long running from this moment, but now he realized that the only way to move forward was to *confront* it.

The agents were closing in now, their forms flickering like static on a broken television. Their movements were strange—neither fully solid nor entirely ethereal. They moved with a strange grace, their steps silent despite the clatter of metal and glass around them. It was as if they had no physical form, only presence.

Jax’s pulse pounded in his ears. He could feel the echoes pressing against him, demanding to be acknowledged. But he wasn’t going to let them take it from him.

He looked at Dr. Kael and Professor Lin, their faces filled with determination. They were here to help him, to stop the agents before they could erase everything.
