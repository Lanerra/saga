The air in the Ashen Docks was always thick with the scent of salt and rust, but tonight it felt heavier, like the weight of a thousand unspoken truths pressed down on Sága’s chest as they trudged through the alleyways back to their quarters. Their boots scuffed against damp stone, each step echoing in the narrow passageways where the wind carried the acrid tang of burnt metal and something more elusive—something like fear.

Inside, the room was small, barely more than a cell with a single window that looked out onto the restless sea. Flickering lights from above cast shifting shadows across the walls, making the cracks in the concrete seem to pulse with life. Sága set their notebook down on the rickety desk and stared at it for a long moment, fingers twitching as they traced the symbols drawn in the frenzy of their nightmare. They weren’t from the Grid’s blueprints—Sága had seen those before, etched in precise lines and glowing with an unnatural precision. These were jagged, uneven, like scars on the page.

“That dream… it felt too real.” Sága whispered to no one, as if speaking aloud might make the memory vanish. They sat down, the wooden chair creaking under their weight, and flipped through the pages of the notebook. The symbols seemed to shift in the dim light, almost as though they were alive, breathing, waiting.

A memory surfaced unbidden—a child’s laughter, bright and joyless, slicing through the darkness like a knife. Sága flinched, pressing their hands to their temples as if to stave off the sound. It was impossible, wasn’t it? The Ashen Docks were a place of survival, not of innocence. And yet, the dream had been so vivid, so real, that they couldn’t shake the feeling that something had been watching them, waiting for them to remember.

The Grid flickered in the distance, its artificial hum punctuated by sudden surges that sent ripples through the air like a heartbeat too fast for its own good. Sága clenched their fists, the unease curling tighter in their gut. They were tired of being afraid, of pretending everything was as it seemed. If this dream was a warning, then they would not ignore it.

The next night, the wind carried a different kind of whisper—cold, urgent. It was Jorin’s voice that cut through the silence, low and deliberate, curling around the edges of Sága’s mind like a serpent seeking prey. They found him in the shadowy alley behind the labor barracks, his silhouette barely visible against the flickering glow of a distant machine.

“You’re not the only one who’s seen the signs, Sága.” His voice was quiet but firm, and for a moment, they thought it might be a trick. Had he been sent by the Council to ensnare them? Or was he another lost soul, like themselves, grasping at something that should never have been known?

Sága hesitated, their hand hovering over the rusted door of the barracks. “What signs?”

Jorin stepped closer, his presence a shadow in the darkness. “The Grid isn’t just failing—it’s being fed something it shouldn’t be.” He leaned against the wall, his voice dropping lower. “People are vanishing. Not by accident. I’ve seen the records. The ones that get taken, they don’t come back.”

Sága felt a chill run through them, not from the night air but from the weight of what he said. They had heard the rumors, of course—workers who never returned from their shifts, others who simply stopped functioning one day, as if their bodies had been drained of something essential. But to hear it spoken so plainly, with such certainty, was another matter entirely.

They looked at Jorin, searching for any sign of deception, but found only the same weary determination that had begun to take root in themselves. “You think I don’t already know that?” Sága said finally, their voice tight with frustration and fear. “I’ve seen it happen. I’ve felt it.”

Jorin’s eyes narrowed. “Then you’re already in over your head. But if you want the truth, I can help you find it. Just tell me what you know about the Grid’s instability.”

Sága hesitated again. Trust was a dangerous thing in the Ashen Docks. One misstep, one wrong word, and they could be branded as a rebel, or worse—disappeared themselves. And yet, Jorin wasn’t asking for anything but information. He wasn’t threatening. He was offering.

“I don’t know much,” Sága admitted after a long pause. “But I’ve seen the symbols. They’re not from the Grid’s blueprints.”

Jorin’s expression shifted—something like recognition flickered across his face before he masked it with a grim smile. “Then you and I have something in common. Meet me at the old storeroom beneath the docks. Midnight. Don’t be late.”

The meeting was set, and Sága knew they had no choice but to go.

The storeroom was damp and cold, its stone walls slick with condensation that dripped in slow, deliberate drops like a clock counting down. The only light came from Jorin’s flickering lantern, casting long shadows that twisted and stretched across the room as if alive. Sága had never been here before, but they could feel the weight of history pressing in on them, the air thick with dust and secrets.

Jorin unrolled a brittle parchment, its edges curling like dead leaves. The map was ancient, its ink faded to a deep, blood-red hue that seemed to pulse under the lantern’s glow. “This,” he said, tapping a section of the map, “wasn’t in any of the Grid blueprints I ever saw. These places—these are burial sites.”

Sága leaned in, their breath catching as they traced the lines with their eyes. “Burial sites? For what?”

Jorin’s gaze was heavy with something Sága couldn’t quite name. “For people. Or something like them.” He gestured to a cluster of symbols near the edge of the map. “The Grid was built on bodies, not blood. But it needs more.”

Sága swallowed hard. “What happens if it runs out?”

Jorin didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he looked at Sága as if weighing them, as if deciding whether they were ready for the truth. When he finally spoke, his voice was low and reverent. “Then the world will fall with it.”

Later that night, back in the labor barracks, Sága sat alone in their room, staring at the flickering Grid lights above. The day had passed in a blur of work, of pretending to be nothing more than another faceless worker, but now the weight of what they had learned pressed down on them like a leaden shroud.

They remembered the day clearly—the one that had never left them. A man had collapsed mid-shift, his body twitching as if something inside him had broken. The others had called it a failure, an accident. But in their mind, it had always felt different. Like the Grid had taken something from him, not just his life.

Was it just a failure… or was it a sacrifice?

Sága’s hands trembled slightly as they reached for the crystalline device they had taken from the hidden chamber beneath the ruins. It sat on their desk now, pulsing faintly with an eerie blue light that seemed to pulse in time with their thoughts. They placed their fingers on its surface and felt a strange warmth spread through them, like a current running beneath their skin.

A whisper curled at the edges of their mind. *You know more than you think.*

They pulled back, heart pounding. Their eyes drifted toward the window where the Grid hummed in the distance. It had always been there, an invisible force that kept the world alive—or perhaps, just barely breathing. But now, it felt like a living thing, watching them, waiting.

The next day, Sága found themselves standing at the edge of the Hollow Expanse with Jorin, the wind howling through the ruins like a mourning wail. The ground beneath them was littered with rusted relics—broken machines, shattered bones, and the remnants of a civilization that had once thrived here. Now it was nothing more than a graveyard of forgotten hopes.

Jorin turned to Sága, his face half-hidden in shadow. “The first Grid,” he began, “was powered by the blood of the lost. Not just any blood, but the blood of those who were taken. The people of Vareth—those who refused to submit, or who knew too much.”

Sága’s breath caught. “They didn’t just die—they were taken.”

Jorin nodded. “And now, it seems, they’re being taken again. The Council isn’t just maintaining power. They’re harvesting it.” He gestured toward the desolate landscape. “This place—it was once home to the greatest minds of Vareth. But they were destroyed because they knew what the Grid really was.”

Sága felt a cold dread settle in their chest. “What happens if we stop it?”

Jorin’s expression darkened. “Then the world will fall with it.” He turned away, his voice barely above a whisper. “But maybe that’s what we need.”

They walked on in silence until they reached a partially collapsed structure, its walls cracked and overgrown with weeds. Inside, Sága’s eyes widened at the sight of the inscriptions—symbols identical to those in their notebook, carved into the stone like wounds.

Jorin knelt beside the entrance and pulled out a small lantern. “This is where one of the Free Scribes left their last records,” he said. “A journal. It might have answers.”

Inside, the air was thick with dust and something else—something ancient and wrong. On a rickety table lay a journal bound in cracked leather, its pages yellowed with time. Sága picked it up carefully, as though it might shatter under their touch.

“This journal talks about the ‘price’ of power,” they read aloud, their voice shaking slightly.

Jorin watched them closely. “They tried to stop it… and were silenced.”

Sága flipped through the pages, their hands trembling. The entries spoke of a ritual, of sacrifices made not out of necessity, but out of greed. “The Grid is not life—it is a ledger,” they read, and the words felt like a curse. A ledger of lives taken in exchange for power.

The ground beneath them trembled suddenly, a low vibration that sent dust cascading from the ceiling. Sága looked up, heart racing. Jorin’s expression turned grim.

“Stay close,” he said, his voice hushed but urgent. “This place is old. Older than the Grid itself.”

They pressed deeper into the ruins, and as they did, Sága felt a strange pull in their chest, like the device they had taken was calling them forward. The walls around them seemed to pulse with energy, the symbols glowing faintly in the dim light.

Then, the tremor grew stronger, and the floor beneath their feet gave way. A hidden chamber opened up, its entrance swallowed by darkness. Sága hesitated only a moment before stepping down into the unknown, Jorin close behind.

Inside, the chamber was lit by the faint glow of bioluminescent fungi clinging to the walls like veins of light. At the center stood a sealed container, its surface etched with the same symbols they had seen in the journal. Inside, a body lay preserved, wrapped in what looked like metal filaments that still hummed with residual energy.

Jorin’s voice was barely a whisper as he pointed to the device beside it. “This is what they used to fuel the Grid.”

Sága reached for it, their fingers brushing against its smooth surface. The moment they touched it, a jolt of energy surged through them, and the world around them blurred. They saw it—not the chamber, not the body, but something else entirely.

People screaming as the Grid drained them, their bodies left behind like husks. A voice echoed in their mind: *You will pay, too.*

They staggered back, clutching their chest as if to steady their racing heart. Jorin caught them, his grip firm but gentle. “This device is not just a key,” he said. “It’s a curse.”

Sága looked at him, eyes wide with something between horror and resolve. “Then I’ll take it,” they said, voice barely above a whisper. “I can’t go back now.”

Jorin exhaled sharply, his expression unreadable. “If you take this, you may never return.”

But Sága didn’t flinch. They had already left behind the world they once knew.

Later that night, as they made their way back toward the docks, Jorin pulled them aside into a quiet alcove near the edge of the city. The hum of the Grid was louder here, vibrating in their bones like an unspoken warning.

“I used to know more,” Jorin said finally, his voice heavy with something that felt like regret. </think>

“I was part of the Free Scribes once,” Jorin said, his voice low and rough, like sandpaper against stone. “Before the Council found me.” His eyes flickered with something between pain and defiance as he ran a hand through his hair, the strands damp from the night’s mist. “They didn’t just take me—they took everything I knew. My name, my past, even my memories of the old world. You see, the Grid wasn’t always what it is now. It started with the Pact of Silence, an agreement made in blood and ink, sealed by those who believed they were saving the city from chaos. But the Council didn’t want to save it. They wanted to control it. And so they came for us.” He paused, his gaze locking onto Sága’s. “They used a ritual. A purge. They called it the ‘Cleansing of the Magi.’ It wasn’t just about erasing knowledge—it was about severing our connection to the Grid itself. To its history. To its truth.” Jorin’s lips pressed into a thin line. “I remember because of this device. It’s the only thing that can bring it back, and now it’s bringing *me* back too. But I’m not sure if I’m ready for what I’ve forgotten.”

Sága frowned. “They took you?”

Jorin nodded, eyes flickering with a memory that wasn’t his own. “They captured me and forced me to forget everything. To live as a laborer, to work for the Council without question.” He looked at Sága now, something like recognition in his gaze. “Now I remember because of this device. It’s the only thing that can bring it back.”

Sága felt a strange kinship with him. “Then we both have something to lose.”

Jorin didn’t answer, but he reached out and placed a hand on Sága’s shoulder. It was a gesture of trust, of understanding. And for the first time, Sága wasn’t sure if it was fear or hope that made their heart pound.

Days passed in a blur of work and whispered meetings. The Grid had become more erratic, its surges stronger, more unpredictable. One evening, as they stood on the docks watching the lights flicker overhead, Jorin turned to Sága with a grim expression.

“You’ve already drawn attention.”

Sága looked up sharply. “What do you mean?”

Jorin’s eyes scanned the horizon, where the distant silhouette of the Citadel of Emberlight loomed like a specter. “The Council has begun to notice disturbances in the Grid. They’re sending enforcers to investigate. If they find out what we’ve uncovered, we won’t be able to run.”

Sága’s hands curled into fists. “Then I’ll be ready.”

That night, Sága returned to their quarters alone, the crystalline device pulsing faintly on the desk. They stared at it for a long time before finally reaching out, their fingers trembling as they touched its surface again.

This time, the reaction was different. The room filled with an unnatural light, and Sága felt something inside them shift—like the Grid had reached into their mind and begun to unravel it. They saw themselves standing at the edge of a great machine, surrounded by bodies that were not dead but *used*, their essence siphoned into the Grid’s core.

A voice whispered in their ear: *You are needed.*

Sága gasped, pulling their hand away. The device dimmed slightly, as if it had noticed their fear. They looked around the room, heart racing, and realized they could no longer pretend to be just another worker, just another face in the crowd.

They had seen too much. Felt too much.

And now, the Grid was reaching for them.

The next night, Jorin led Sága through the darkened alleys of the docks, their path winding toward a hidden meeting place beneath a rusted cargo container. There, they found others—dockworkers who had noticed the same strange patterns in the Grid’s failures. Their faces were lined with exhaustion and fear, but there was also something else: determination.

“They take the ones who fall first,” one of them said, their voice low. “Not just to replace them. To feed it.”

Sága felt a flicker of hope. They weren’t alone in this. Others had seen the signs, others had felt the Grid’s hunger. Maybe, just maybe, they could find a way to stop it together.

“You’re not the only one who’s seen the signs,” another worker said, and Sága nodded, their resolve hardening like steel.

But the hope was short-lived.

The next day, as they returned from the docks, a patrol of Dominion Enforcers arrived, their presence an iron wall between Sága and the world they had once known. The enforcers were clad in dark, reinforced armor that shimmered faintly with aetheric energy, their faces obscured by helmets that seemed to pulse with a life of their own.

Jorin’s voice was tense as he spoke. “Nothing more than usual failures.”

But one of the enforcers turned sharply, his gaze piercing through the shadows. “Watch your step, laborer.”

Sága felt their stomach twist. They had been careless. Too many questions. Too much curiosity.

Later that night, Jorin led them to a hidden library beneath the ruins, its shelves lined with old tomes and artifacts that had long been forgotten. The air was thick with dust and the weight of history. As they searched through the records, Sága’s hands shook when they found the entry that described the Grid’s origin.

“They were called ‘the Offered.’” Jorin read aloud, his voice filled with something like sorrow. “The Grid doesn’t just need energy—it needs souls.”

Sága’s breath caught. They looked up at him, eyes wide. “I’ve been part of this system all along.”

Jorin nodded slowly. “And now you know the truth. And they’ll come for you.”

As they left the safehouse, the ground beneath them trembled—not from the Grid, but from something else. A hidden sensor had been triggered, and before they could react, a group of enforcers emerged from the shadows, their weapons drawn.

“You’ve been meddling with things you don’t understand,” one of them said, stepping forward. “You’re coming with us.”

Jorin didn’t hesitate. He reached into his coat and pulled out a small device that looked like a broken compass. With a flick of his wrist, he activated it, sending a pulse through the air that rippled outward like a shockwave.

The enforcers staggered back, their weapons sparking as the Grid’s energy surged in an unexpected direction. Jorin turned to Sága, his voice urgent. “Run, Sága. Don’t let their lies win.”

Sága lunged forward, grabbing Jorin’s arm. “No! I won’t lose you again!”

But Jorin was already moving, using the moment of confusion to lead them away. He didn’t look back. He didn’t need to.

The enforcers recovered quickly, their eyes narrowing at the retreating figures. “Find her,” one growled. “And bring her in.”

Sága ran through the Hollow Expanse, the wind howling around them as they clutched Jorin’s journal and the crystalline device. The ground beneath them was littered with the remnants of a forgotten world, but now it felt like a path to something greater than themselves.

They had seen what the Grid was. They had felt its hunger. And now, they knew what it needed.

“I won’t let this continue,” Sága whispered into the wind as they disappeared into the ruins, the device pulsing in their palm like a heartbeat.

*The cost of power is too high.*

And so, with that thought, they stepped forward into the unknown.
