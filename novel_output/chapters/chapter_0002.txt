Isabelle stepped through the door and found herself standing in a place that defied all logic. The air was thick with an eerie stillness, as if the world itself held its breath. Around her stretched an expanse of impossible landscapes—fields of glass that shimmered like liquid silver, trees with roots coiled like serpents, and skies that shifted colors with each heartbeat. Time had no meaning here; it ebbed and flowed like a river without banks. The carnival was gone, replaced by this surreal realm where reality bent and twisted in ways she could not fully comprehend.

She took a cautious step forward, her boots making no sound on the ground beneath her. A faint hum filled the air, vibrating through her bones like a distant melody. It was both beautiful and unsettling, as though the world around her was alive, watching, waiting. Isabelle’s fingers brushed against the fabric of her coat, grounding her in the present. She had to remember: this place was not real. It was a construct, a dream woven from threads of forgotten hopes and lost dreams.

She had no idea how long she had been here, but the sensation of time being irrelevant weighed heavily on her. The carnival had led her here, through its endless corridors and shifting mirrors, past illusions that whispered secrets only she could hear. Now, standing in this surreal world, she felt as though she were walking on the edge of a precipice, teetering between reality and something far more dangerous.

A sudden gust of wind—though there was no wind—rippled through the air, carrying with it a scent that was both familiar and foreign. It smelled like lavender and burnt sugar, like memories long buried beneath layers of dust. Isabelle turned her head, searching for the source, but the landscape shifted again, rearranging itself in an instant. The trees moved, their branches stretching toward her as if reaching out to embrace her.

She took a breath, steadying herself. She had come here for a reason. The carnival was not just a place of entertainment; it was something more, something ancient and insidious. But what Isabelle didn’t realize was that the carnival had been watching her all along, weaving its illusions around her like threads in a tapestry. Every mirror she passed, every performer she saw, every shadow that whispered secrets—each was a piece of the Sanguine Veil, an unseen force that stretched beyond the carnival’s borders and into the very fabric of her mind. The Veil was not just a veil; it was a prison, a construct that fed on the dreams of those who entered its embrace, reshaping them into something else entirely. And Isabelle, with her unshakable sense of self, had become its most dangerous prize. And she was part of its design, whether she liked it or not.

A voice broke through the silence, soft yet commanding, like the whisper of a forgotten lullaby. “You’ve come far, Isabelle.”

She spun around, heart pounding. A figure stood before her, half-shrouded in shadows that seemed to pulse with their own life. Their face was obscured by a veil of silver mist, but their presence was undeniable. They exuded an aura of calm authority, as if they had been waiting for her all along.

“I—I don’t know who you are,” Isabelle said, her voice barely above a whisper.

The figure stepped closer, the shadows around them shifting like ink in water. Isabelle’s breath caught in her throat. “You’re… a soul collector?”

 “Yes. And you, Isabelle, are not lost. You are here because you were meant to be.”

Her mind reeled. The carnival had led her here, but why? What did it want from her? She had always believed she was just a visitor, an observer in a world that existed outside of time. But now, standing before this enigmatic figure, she felt the weight of something far greater pressing down on her.

“I don’t understand,” she said, her voice trembling slightly. “What is this place? What are you doing here?”

The figure extended a hand, and for a moment, Isabelle felt as though they could reach through the veil of time and touch her very soul. “This is the Realm of Forgotten Dreams,” they said. “A place where lost hopes take shape, where dreams that have been abandoned by their owners find solace. But not all who come here are welcome.”

“Some come seeking answers. Others seek escape. And some… come to be taken.”

A chill ran down her spine. She had heard whispers of this place in the carnival, of souls being claimed by something unseen, something that thrived on despair and longing. But she had never imagined she might be one of them.

“I’m not here for that,” she said, gripping the edge of her coat. “I came to find out what the carnival is. What it wants from me.”

The figure studied her for a long moment, their gaze piercing through the veil of mist. “You are stronger than you think, Isabelle. But strength alone will not save you. You must understand what you are facing before it is too late.”

Isabelle swallowed hard, trying to steady her thoughts. “What do I need to know?”

The figure’s voice softened, almost like a sigh. “The carnival is not just a place of illusion. It is a vessel, a conduit for something far older than the world you know. The Sanguine Heart is its core, and it feeds on the dreams of those who enter its embrace.”

Isabelle’s heart pounded. She had heard of the Sanguine Heart before—fragments of stories whispered by the carnival’s performers, tales of a heart that pulsed with the very essence of life itself. It was said to be a relic from an age when dreams and reality were one, when hope and despair walked hand in hand.

She asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

The figure’s gaze darkened. “Because you are not just a visitor. You are part of its design. You have been chosen, Isabelle. Whether you like it or not, you are bound to this place.”

A wave of nausea washed over her. She had always felt different from the others in the carnival, as if she were watching something unfold from the outside rather than being a part of it. But now, standing before this figure, she realized the truth: she was not an observer. She was a piece of the puzzle.

“Why me?” The figure stepped closer, their presence pressing against her like a weight. “Because you carry something that others cannot. You have seen what lies beyond the veil, what the carnival hides from its visitors.  She had always felt as though she were being watched, as though there was something watching her from the shadows of the carnival. But now, standing in this surreal world, she understood: she was not just a visitor. She was a target.

“I don’t want to be part of this,” she said, her voice barely audible.

The figure’s expression shifted, their misty veil flickering like candlelight. “You cannot escape what you are. But you can choose how you face it.”  The figure inclined their head, the mist around them swirling like smoke.                                 “I am what remains of those who have lost their way. I am the keeper of dreams and hopes, the collector of souls left behind in the wake of forgotten desires.”

                                          Isabelle closed her eyes, trying to steady herself. She had come here seeking answers, but now she felt as though she had been drawn into something far greater than she could comprehend. The carnival was not just a place of illusion—it was a living entity, and she was its key.

She opened her eyes, meeting the figure’s gaze once more. “What do you want from me?”

The figure’s voice was quiet, almost reverent. “I want you to understand what is at stake.  It reshapes them, reforges them into something new.   But now she realized: that choice had already been made.

She took a step back, the weight of the moment pressing down on her like an anchor. “I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.”

The figure’s misty veil shimmered, and for a moment, Isabelle saw something beneath it—something ancient, something vast. “Then you must find your own way,” they said. “But be warned: the deeper you go, the more you will lose of yourself.  She had no idea what lay ahead, but one thing was certain: she could not turn back now.

With a final glance at the figure, she turned away, stepping deeper into the surreal world. The path before her was uncertain, but she would face it head-on. Because if there was one thing she had learned from the carnival, it was that dreams were not just illusions—they were the last remnants of who we are.

And she would not let them be taken without a fight.
