The hum of the memory retrieval unit was a low, mechanical whisper in the cavernous silence of Sága’s workshop. Flickering neon signs from the outside world barely reached through the cracked window, casting long shadows over shelves that groaned with the weight of countless orbs—each one a fragment of someone else’s life, carefully cataloged and stored for sale. The air was thick with the scent of ozone and something metallic, like old blood or rusting circuits, an inescapable reminder of the city’s unrelenting grip on time and memory.

She ran her fingers over the cold surface of the unit, its intricate gears clicking in response to her touch. It had been a long day, one where she’d traded memories for credits, each transaction another small surrender to the system that ruled Virellis. But tonight, she wasn’t selling anything. Tonight, she was searching.

The compartment had appeared as if by accident. A seam in the side of the retrieval unit, barely noticeable, had caught her eye when she wiped away a smear of dust. She’d pried it open with a rusted screwdriver, heart hammering against her ribs, and inside lay something that should not have been there—a folded piece of paper, brittle with age, and a small map tucked within a glass case. The map was old, its edges worn, and the ink had faded in places, but the coordinates were unmistakable.

“This isn’t part of the system… why is it here?” she muttered to herself, her voice barely more than a breath. She turned the paper over, tracing the lines with her fingertips. The address led to the old district, a place few dared to tread now that the Council had sealed it off after the last rebellion. It was said the district was haunted by the echoes of those who had lost too much.

Lir’s voice cut through the quiet. “Sága?”

She startled, nearly dropping the map. He stood just inside the doorway, his eyes scanning the room with a look that had become familiar—concerned, but not without purpose. His presence was an anchor, though she hadn’t called him. Not yet. She turned back to the unit, her fingers tightening around the glass case.

“I found something,” she said, voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. “A map. It points to The Schoolhouse.”

Lir stepped closer, his brow furrowing. “The Schoolhouse? That’s not just abandoned. That’s cursed.” He gestured toward the shelves of orbs. “You know what they say about that place. If you go there, you don’t come back the same.”

Sága didn’t answer immediately. She stared at the map, her mind racing with possibilities. What if it led to something she was never meant to find? The thought coiled in her gut like a serpent, but it couldn’t be ignored. Something about this place, about these symbols on the map and the journal, felt personal.

“You’re not going alone again,” Lir said finally, his voice firm. “I’ve seen what happens when you hide things.”

She turned to face him, her expression unreadable. “Lir, I don’t want you involved in this. You don’t know what you’re risking.”

He crossed his arms, the light from a nearby orb casting strange shadows across his face. “And I suppose you do? You think hiding it makes you safe? I’ve watched you go through those memories, Sága. I know how they change you. You can’t keep running from it.”

Her breath caught in her throat. He was right, of course. Every time she retrieved a memory, it chipped away at the carefully constructed walls she’d built around herself. She had survived by forgetting, by trading pieces of her past for credits and safety. But now, something inside her was beginning to crack.

She looked down at the map again. The Schoolhouse. A place that had been erased from the city’s records, a relic of a time before the Memory Trade became law. Before the Council tightened its grip on every citizen’s mind.

If she let him come, she risked everything—her carefully maintained anonymity, her life, maybe even her very identity. But if she went alone, what would she find? What if it was exactly what she needed to remember?

“I can’t do this without help,” she whispered, almost to herself.

Lir’s eyes softened. “I know.”

The air between them was thick with something unspoken, a tension that had been building since the day he first walked into her workshop, his hands stained with the same kind of dust and desperation she carried in her own.

They left the workshop under the cover of night, the city above them shrouded in artificial light that never truly reached the lower district. The streets were narrow, choked with the remnants of a world that had once been more than just a system of survival. Here, in the underbelly of Virellis, the decay was more visible, more visceral. Statues of forgotten leaders cracked and crumbled, their faces eroded by time and neglect. Overgrown vines clung to rusting metal signs, some of which bore names she could no longer recall.

“This place is worse than I remembered,” Lir said as they stepped into the alleyway, the glow of memory orbs flickering from a nearby vendor’s cart. The neon signs cast long, shifting shadows across their faces.

Sága didn’t respond. She was too caught up in the feeling that something in this place was watching her, waiting. Her fingers brushed against the map again, and she could almost hear the whispers of the past, echoing through the broken streets.

She stopped suddenly, her hand pressing against a wall covered in peeling paint. There, beneath layers of grime, were markings—symbols that looked exactly like those on the memory orbs they had retrieved before. Her pulse quickened as she traced the lines with her fingertip.

“These markings… they look like the ones from the memory orbs,” she said, voice hushed.

Lir peered over her shoulder, his expression shifting from concern to intrigue. “That’s not just coincidence.”

Sága nodded slowly. She had always thought these symbols were part of the trade system, a kind of code for cataloging memories. But now, standing in this place where the past had been buried, she wondered if they meant something else entirely.

They continued walking, deeper into the district, the air growing colder with each step. The silence was not empty—it was filled with the weight of history, the ghosts of those who had once lived here, who had once remembered.

Then, as they rounded a corner, Sága stopped again. A child’s drawing was scrawled on the wall in red chalk, its lines jagged and uneven. It depicted a figure standing at the edge of a dark door, arms outstretched. The image was familiar, though she couldn’t place it.

“What is that?” Lir asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Sága swallowed hard. “I think… I remember something like this.”

The words hung between them, heavy with implication. She didn’t know what they meant, only that the memory was there, waiting to be unearthed.

They reached The Schoolhouse just as the wind began to howl through the broken windows, carrying with it the scent of damp stone and something older, more primal. The building loomed before them, its once-proud façade now a skeletal remains of its former self. Shattered glass reflected the dim glow of the city above, and inside, the air was thick with dust and decay.

“This symbol matches the one on the orb you found,” Lir said, pointing to a faded mark on the door. It was the same as the one from the map, etched into the rusted metal like a scar.

Sága hesitated. The weight of the moment pressed against her chest. Her hands trembled slightly as she reached for the symbol. If she pressed it, if she opened that door, would it be to salvation or ruin?

Lir noticed her hesitation and stepped closer. “What are you afraid of?”

She didn’t answer immediately. She was afraid of everything—of what lay behind that door, of what it might reveal about herself, of what the Council might do if they found out she was here. But more than anything, she was afraid of the truth.

She pressed the symbol.

The door groaned open with a sound like a living thing exhaling. Inside, the air was colder, the silence heavier. The classroom was in disarray—desks broken, books scattered across the floor, and a single rusted cabinet standing in the back, its hinges creaking in the stillness.

Lir stepped inside first, his eyes darting around the room. “This place is like a tomb.”

Sága didn’t respond. Her gaze was fixed on the cabinet. She had felt something pull her here, some unseen thread of memory and fate. The Council had always known about this place, but they had buried it, erased it from the city’s records. Why?

She approached the cabinet slowly, her fingers hovering over the latch. Lir watched her, his expression unreadable.

“Why are you even here?” he asked. “You could have just left it be.”

Sága turned to face him, her voice quiet but firm. “Because I need to know what they took from me.”

She opened the cabinet with a soft click, revealing rows of memory orbs stacked neatly in their slots. Each one pulsed faintly, as if holding its breath. Some were labeled in neat handwriting, others left blank. But then she saw them—three orbs marked with her name.

Lir let out a low whistle. “These aren’t for sale… they’re being hidden.”

She picked up one of the orbs, her hands steady despite the storm of emotions inside her. “Why would my memories be locked away?”

Lir didn’t answer. He was watching her, waiting for her to decide what to do next.

She placed the orb into the retrieval unit she had brought with her. The machine whirred to life, its lights flickering as it prepared to extract the memory. She closed her eyes, bracing herself for the flood of recollection that would come.

The moment the memory began, the world around her faded into a blur of color and sound. She was standing in a sterile room, the air sharp with the scent of antiseptic and something else—something metallic, like blood. A man in a white coat stood over her, his face obscured by the glow of overhead lights. She was younger, much younger, strapped to a chair that hummed with energy.

“This isn’t just a memory… it’s a record,” she whispered as the vision unfolded before her.

Lir leaned closer, transfixed. “Sága, what are you seeing?”

She didn’t answer. Her breath was shallow, her body rigid with the weight of the memory. She could feel the needle pressing into her arm, the cold rush of the serum as it entered her veins. The pain was not physical, but mental—a tearing, a pulling, a sensation that she had been split apart.

“I was never just a dealer… I was a test subject.”

Lir’s face paled. “That’s not possible.”

She turned to him, eyes wide with something between fear and revelation. “It is. They took my memories, Lir. Not for trade. For study.”

The room seemed to close in around them, the weight of the truth pressing down like a collapsing ceiling. She had always known she was different, that her memories were fragmented in ways others weren’t. But now, she understood why.

She reached for another orb—this one marked with a name she hadn’t heard in years. Her mother’s name.

Lir caught her hand before she could touch it. “Sága, are you sure about this?”

She didn’t pull away. “I have to be.”

His grip tightened slightly. “They say those who take too many memories go mad or disappear.”

“I know,” she said, her voice soft. “But I’ve spent too long being a pawn. I won’t anymore.”

Lir looked at her, something in his eyes shifting from concern to something else—something like admiration. Or maybe fear.

They turned back to the cabinet, and Lir’s gaze landed on a small, leather-bound journal tucked between two orbs. He pulled it out carefully, its pages yellowed with age.

Sága leaned over as he opened it. The handwriting was precise, clinical. There were notes about memory patterns, about neural pathways, about subjects who had resisted the process. And then, scrawled in a different hand, was a name—Subject S-12.

Her breath caught. “That has to be me.”

She flipped through the pages, her fingers trembling as she found more entries, more names. Some were familiar, others not. But all of them had been experimented on, their memories extracted and studied in ways that made her stomach churn.

“This is proof,” she murmured. “But who wrote this?”

Lir looked up from the journal. “Someone who knew what the Council was doing.”

She stared at the pages, her mind racing. If someone had recorded these things, if they had documented the experiments, then there were others who had known. Others who had resisted.

Her hands clenched into fists. “This isn’t just about me. It’s about everyone.”

Lir hesitated, but she could see the determination in his eyes now. He was no longer just her assistant. He was something more—someone who saw what she had been blind to.

“We take more,” he said finally. “We need to know everything.”

Sága looked at him, her heart pounding. The thought of retrieving more memories filled her with a strange mix of dread and exhilaration. She had spent years trading away pieces of herself, each one a step further from who she once was. But now, she saw the pattern—the Council wasn’t just taking memories for profit. They were taking them to control.

The idea sent a shiver down her spine.

She hesitated only for a moment before nodding. “Let’s do it.”

They returned to the cabinet and selected another orb, this one marked with a name that made Sága’s breath hitch—her mother’s. She held it in her palm, feeling its weight, its significance. What had she been willing to lose to save her daughter?

She placed it into the retrieval unit and closed her eyes.

The memory hit her like a wave. She was standing in a lab again, but this time, she wasn’t the subject. Her mother stood before a panel of Council scientists, her face pale, her hands trembling. She was not strapped to a chair, not under the control of machines. Instead, she was offering something—her own memories.

Sága’s vision blurred as she watched her mother step forward, placing her hand over a scanner. The machine whirred to life, and then there was light—brilliant, blinding. Her mother’s face twisted in pain, but she didn’t stop. She kept offering, one memory after another, until the panel of scientists nodded in approval.

“She gave everything… and I never knew.”

The words echoed in her mind as she pulled away from the retrieval unit, gasping for air. Lir was watching her, silent, his face unreadable.

“I was never alone in this,” she whispered. “My mother chose to let me live.”

She turned to him, her voice steady now. “This is why I can’t stop now. My mother’s memory was stolen from her.”

Lir reached out, his hand hovering near hers but not touching. “I know. But Sága… this isn’t just dangerous. It’s life-changing.”

She met his gaze, something in her eyes hardening. “I’ve spent too long being a pawn. I won’t anymore.”

The room seemed to shift around them, the weight of the past pressing down like a storm about to break. They had come looking for answers and found a truth that would change everything.

As they prepared to leave, something strange happened. One of the orbs on the table began to pulse violently, its glow shifting from the usual blue to a deep, ominous red. Sága felt it before she saw it, a pull in her chest, like someone was watching her from within the memory itself.

“That orb,” Lir said, his voice low. “It’s not just reacting to us.”

She looked at it, her fingers twitching with the urge to reach for it. The past wasn’t done with her yet.
