Kaelen moved through the lower corridors of Thal’Zirath, their breath shallow, their pulse a steady drumbeat in their ears. The air here was different—thicker, as though it carried the weight of something unseen. The architecture shifted subtly, walls that had once been straight now bent at impossible angles, and the floor beneath their boots seemed to ripple like water, though they knew it was solid stone. It wasn’t just a city… it’s something alive.

The resonance in their mind pulsed again, a low vibration that started deep in their skull and spread outward. It wasn’t sound, not exactly—it was more like a memory, or perhaps a whisper from a place they had never been but somehow remembered. Kaelen stopped, pressing a hand to the nearest wall, feeling the faint hum beneath their fingertips. The city was alive, and it was watching them.

They had come here seeking answers, but now they felt as though they were being drawn into something far greater than themselves. This wasn’t just curiosity anymore—it was inevitability. A pull that couldn’t be ignored. Why do I feel this pull?

The corridors narrowed, the light dimming as they descended deeper. The city’s glow, which had been a soft, ambient hum in the upper levels, now flickered erratically, casting long shadows that seemed to move on their own. Kaelen’s footsteps echoed, but the echoes weren’t quite right—too slow, too stretched, like they were being swallowed by something that didn’t want to let them go.

They reached a threshold of sorts, a doorway carved from obsidian and inlaid with silver filigree that pulsed faintly. The air here was colder, and Kaelen could feel the weight of something ancient pressing against their thoughts. They hesitated, but the resonance grew stronger, more insistent. It wasn’t a choice anymore. It was a command.

Kaelen stepped through.

The chamber beyond was vast, its walls covered in carvings that seemed to shift when viewed from different angles. The ceiling arched impossibly high, and the floor was a mosaic of interlocking symbols, some of which Kaelen recognized from the fragments they had seen before—symbols that spoke of sleep, of dreaming, of something vast and unknowable beneath the city.

And then they saw it.

A mural stretched across one wall, its colors faded but still vivid in their mind’s eye. It depicted a massive, slumbering form, its body coiled around the city like a serpent wrapped around a nest. The creature’s features were indistinct, blurred by time and the passage of centuries, but its presence was undeniable. It was not just a myth. It was real.

Kaelen’s breath caught in their throat. This wasn’t just a legend passed down through generations—it was a warning. A memory etched into the very bones of the city. They reached out, fingers brushing against the cold stone, and felt something stir beneath their touch. A whisper in the silence, almost like a memory.

What if the city is built on top of something that dreams?

The thought sent a shiver through them. If this was true, then Thal’Zirath wasn’t just a place—it was a prison. A slumbering god buried beneath the streets, its dreams shaping the world above. But why? And who had placed it here?

Kaelen turned away from the mural, their mind racing. They needed to find someone who could help them make sense of this. Someone who knew more than they did. The only person who might have answers was Lira Vey.

The archive was deep within the oldest tower of Thal’Zirath, a place where time seemed to move differently. Kaelen had been here before, but never like this—never with the weight of something so vast pressing against their mind. The air was thick with the scent of old parchment and ink, and the walls were lined with shelves that stretched into the darkness.

Lira Vey was waiting for them, her expression unreadable as she looked up from a stack of ancient scrolls. She had always been cautious, but tonight, there was something else in her eyes—fear, perhaps, or the weight of knowing too much.

“You feel it, don’t you?” she asked, her voice low, almost a whisper.

Kaelen nodded, unable to speak. The resonance in their mind was louder now, as if the city itself was trying to communicate with them.

Lira stood, moving with the grace of someone who had spent a lifetime among forgotten things. “They called it the Sleeper,” she said, her fingers tracing the edge of one of the scrolls. “But no one dares speak its name.”

Kaelen’s throat tightened. “Why not?”

“Because some truths are meant to stay buried.” Lira’s gaze was steady, but there was a flicker of something in her eyes—regret, perhaps, or the lingering fear of what had been lost.

Kaelen stepped closer, their voice barely above a whisper. “What if it’s waking up?”

Lira didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she reached for a different scroll, one that looked older than the others, its edges brittle with age. She unrolled it slowly, revealing a series of symbols and diagrams that Kaelen recognized from the mural.

“You’ve seen the dream-echo,” Lira said, her voice tight with something that sounded like dread. “You’ve felt it. And I know you’ve seen the visions.”

Kaelen swallowed hard. “I don’t understand what’s happening to me.”

Lira sighed, closing the scroll and placing it back on the table. “It’s not just about the dream-echo. It’s about the Sleeper itself. The city is built on its dreams, and if something wakes it… we won’t survive it.”

Kaelen’s heart pounded in their chest. “Then why hasn’t anyone done anything?”

Lira met their gaze, her expression unreadable. “Because the knowledge is dangerous. It changes people. Some lose themselves in it, consumed by what they’ve seen. Others… they become something else entirely.”

The words sent a chill through Kaelen. They had felt it before—the pull of something deeper, something that whispered to them in the silence. Now, with Lira’s warning echoing in their mind, they realized the truth: the dream-echo wasn’t just a phenomenon. It was a gateway. A way into something vast and unknowable.

And Kaelen had already crossed the threshold.

The chamber where the relics were kept was unlike anything Kaelen had ever seen. The walls were lined with glowing symbols, their light pulsing in a rhythm that matched the beat of Kaelen’s own heart. The air was thick with energy, and the floor beneath their feet seemed to hum with an ancient power.

Kaelen hesitated at the threshold, their breath shallow. They had come here seeking answers, but now they felt as though they were standing at the edge of something far greater than themselves. The resonance in their mind grew stronger, more insistent, and Kaelen knew that whatever lay ahead would change them forever.

They stepped forward.

The moment their fingers brushed against the ancient artifact—a small, crystalline object embedded in the wall—Kaelen’s vision blurred. The world around them dissolved, and they were no longer standing in the chamber but somewhere else entirely.

It was a dream, or perhaps something more. A place that felt both familiar and alien, where the sky was a swirling mass of color and the ground beneath their feet pulsed like a living thing. Kaelen looked around, their breath catching in their throat.

This wasn’t just a vision. It was real.

And it was terrifying.

The creature loomed in the distance, its form shifting and writhing, as if it were made of liquid light and shadow. Its eyes—deep, endless voids—watched Kaelen with an intelligence that sent a shiver down their spine. The dream-echo was here, and it was watching them.

Kaelen tried to move, but the ground beneath them felt like quicksand, pulling them deeper into the nightmare. They reached out, trying to grasp something tangible, but everything around them was just… more of the same. More dreams, more memories, more echoes of a truth that had been buried for centuries.

And then they saw it—the corruption.

It was in the dream itself, a black stain spreading through the light, twisting the creature’s form into something unrecognizable. It wasn’t just dreaming anymore—it was being changed, consumed by something that didn’t belong to it. Kaelen could feel it now, the weight of it pressing against their mind, whispering promises of knowledge and power.

This isn’t just a dream… it’s a nightmare.

Kaelen stumbled back, their breath ragged. The vision faded, and they found themselves back in the chamber, their body trembling with the remnants of what they had seen. They clutched the artifact, their fingers shaking. The dream-echo wasn’t just a phenomenon—it was a force, and it was growing.

They needed to find Lira. They needed answers. But as Kaelen stepped out of the chamber, they could feel something else now—a presence, watching them from the depths of the city, waiting for them to return.

The market square was alive with the hum of daily life, but beneath the surface, there was an undercurrent of fear. People moved with hushed voices, their eyes darting toward the shadows as if they feared being seen. Kaelen felt it too—the weight of something unspoken, a tension that had settled over the city like a storm on the horizon.

They moved through the crowd, their mind still reeling from the vision. The dream-echo was spreading, and with it, something else—something darker. The whispers in the air were no longer just about the city’s history or its mysteries. They were about the sickness that had taken hold of those who spoke too much, too loudly.

Kaelen overheard a conversation as they passed a group of merchants huddled together, their faces pale and drawn.

“They say if you know too much… you lose yourself,” one of them murmured, their voice barely above a whisper. “It spreads through words. Through knowledge.”

Another nodded, their eyes wide with something like dread. “I’ve seen it happen. They just… stop. Like they’re not even there anymore.”

Kaelen’s heart pounded in their chest. This wasn’t just a myth. It was real, and it was spreading.

They needed to find Lira. Needed to understand what they had seen, what they had felt. But as they turned to leave the square, a new fear settled over them—what if they were already infected?

The thought sent a chill through their spine. What if the dream-echo had already taken hold of them? What if they were no longer just a witness to the truth, but part of it?

Kaelen pushed the thought aside, forcing themselves to move forward. They couldn’t afford to let fear take over. Not now.

Lira’s residence was quiet, the air thick with the scent of old books and candle wax. Kaelen hesitated at the door, their breath shallow. This wasn’t just a visit—it was a confrontation. A reckoning. Lira had known more than she had let on, and Kaelen needed to know why.

She was waiting for them, her expression tense as she led them into a secluded room lit by flickering lanterns. The walls were lined with ancient texts, their pages yellowed with age. Kaelen could feel the weight of the knowledge in the air, the presence of something vast and unknowable pressing against their thoughts.

“You already know,” Lira said, her voice low, almost a whisper. “You’ve felt it.”

Kaelen nodded, their hands trembling. “I saw the dream-echo. I saw the Sleeper. And I saw the corruption.”

Lira’s eyes darkened with something that looked like fear. “Then you understand what’s at stake.”

“You told me some truths are meant to stay buried,” Kaelen said, their voice steady despite the storm raging inside them. “But if we don’t act… if we don’t stop this—what happens?”

Lira hesitated, her gaze flickering to the texts on the walls. “If the Dreamer dies… what happens to us?”

Kaelen’s breath caught in their throat. “You’re saying it’s alive.”

“It’s not just alive,” Lira said, her voice tight with something that sounded like desperation. “It’s the foundation of this city. The balance of reality itself. If it falls… everything collapses.”

Kaelen felt a chill run through them. They had always known Thal’Zirath was different, but they hadn’t realized how deeply it was tied to something far greater. The city wasn’t just built on a dream—it was built on a guardian, a being that had once kept the world in balance.

And now, that balance was threatened.

“You already feel it, don’t you?” Lira asked, her voice barely above a whisper. “The pull of the truth.”

Kaelen nodded, their heart pounding. “I do.”

Lira’s expression softened, but there was still fear in her eyes. “Then you must understand—this knowledge is not just dangerous. It’s lethal.”

Kaelen took a deep breath, steadying themselves. “Then tell me everything.”

The chamber beneath the city was dark, its walls lined with flickering lights that cast shifting shadows across the stone. The air was thick with something ancient, something that had been waiting for them. Kaelen moved forward cautiously, their heart pounding in their chest.

They had followed the dream-echo here, drawn by a force they couldn’t explain. And now, as they stepped into the chamber, they saw them—people in a trance-like state, their eyes wide and unseeing, their mouths moving in a slow, rhythmic repetition.

“The truth is… the truth is… the truth is…”

Kaelen’s breath caught in their throat. They had heard this before, in the whispers of the city, in the echoes of the dream-echo. But now, seeing it with their own eyes, it was more terrifying than anything they had imagined.

They stepped closer, their heart pounding. The people were not unconscious—they were still here, trapped in a state of endless repetition, their minds consumed by something they could no longer escape.

Kaelen’s hands trembled as they reached out, hesitating before touching one of the trance victims. Their skin was cold, and there was no response—no flicker of recognition, no sign that they were even aware of Kaelen’s presence.

They pulled their hand back, their mind racing. What if I’m already infected?

The thought sent a shiver through them. Had the dream-echo already taken hold of them? Had they become part of this nightmare, trapped in a cycle of endless repetition, unable to escape?

Kaelen turned away from the trance victims, their breath ragged. They needed to find Lira, to understand what was happening to them. But as they moved toward the exit, something shifted in the air—a presence, watching them, waiting.

The Thoughtstorms were different now. The chamber that had once been a place of quiet contemplation and ancient knowledge now pulsed with an energy that felt… wrong. The walls seemed to shift, their patterns twisting into unfamiliar shapes, and the air was thick with something Kaelen couldn’t quite name.

They stepped inside, their heart pounding. This was where they had first encountered the dream-echo, where the city’s architects and dream-weavers gathered to maintain its delicate balance. But now, it felt like something else entirely—like a place that had been altered, changed by the same force that had consumed the trance victims.

Kaelen moved toward the center of the chamber, their breath shallow. The Thoughtstorms had always been a place of quiet power, but now, they felt like a storm on the verge of breaking. The symbols on the walls pulsed with an unnatural light, and Kaelen could feel something pressing against their mind, whispering things they couldn’t quite understand.

They reached out, their fingers brushing against one of the glowing symbols. A surge of energy coursed through them, and for a moment, everything went dark.

When they opened their eyes, they were no longer in the Thoughtstorms. They were somewhere else—somewhere vast and endless, where the sky was a swirling mass of color and the ground beneath their feet pulsed like a living thing.

The dream-echo was here, and it was watching them.

Kaelen tried to move, but the world around them felt impossibly heavy, as if they were being pulled deeper into something that didn’t want to let them go. They reached out, trying to grasp something tangible, but everything was just more of the same—more dreams, more echoes of a truth that had been buried for centuries.

And then they saw it—the dream-echo itself, a shifting, sentient force that pulsed with an awareness that sent a chill through Kaelen’s spine. It wasn’t just a memory or a vision—it was something else entirely, something that had been waiting for them all along.

Kaelen stumbled back, their breath ragged. The dream-echo wasn’t just consuming the city—it was feeding on the truth itself, growing stronger with every revelation, every whisper of knowledge.

This isn’t just a memory… it’s aware.

They turned, trying to find a way out, but the world around them shifted again, and suddenly, they were no longer in the dream. They were back in the Thoughtstorms, their body trembling with the weight of what they had seen.

Kaelen collapsed to their knees, their mind reeling. The dream-echo wasn’t just spreading—it was evolving, becoming something more than it had ever been. And if they didn’t stop it… the city would fall, and with it, everything they knew.

The Thoughtstorms were changing, and so was Kaelen. They could feel it in their bones, in the way the air around them pulsed with an energy that felt both familiar and alien. The city was no longer just a place—it was a living thing, and Kaelen had become part of it.

They needed to find Lira, to understand what they had seen, what they had felt. But as they stood, their breath ragged, they knew one thing for certain: the truth was no longer something they could walk away from.

It had already found them.

Kaelen moved through the city’s hidden corridors, their mind racing with the weight of everything they had learned. The Erebus Order had warned them, but Kaelen had already crossed the threshold. They had seen the dream-echo, had felt its presence in their mind, and now, it was too late to turn back.

They reached a hidden corridor, its walls lined with flickering lanterns that cast long, shifting shadows. The air was cold, and the silence was thick with something Kaelen couldn’t quite name.

And then they heard the voices.

“Do you understand what you’re risking?” one of them said, their voice low and steady. “Some knowledge is a poison… and you’ve already drunk it.”

Kaelen turned, their heart pounding. A group of figures emerged from the shadows, their faces obscured by hoods. They were the Erebus Order—those who had once guarded the city’s secrets, those who had known the truth and chosen to keep it hidden.

“You don’t understand what you’re doing,” another voice said, this one colder, more dangerous. “If you speak the truth, the city will die with you.”

Kaelen stood their ground, their mind reeling from the weight of their choices. The dream-echo was spreading, and if they didn’t act now, there wouldn’t be anything left to save.

“I don’t have a choice,” Kaelen said, their voice steady despite the fear clawing at their chest. “If I don’t stop it… everything will fall.”

The leader of the Erebus Order stepped forward, their gaze piercing. “You think you can control what you’ve seen? That knowledge is not just dangerous—it’s lethal.”

Kaelen met their gaze, their heart pounding. “Then let me try.”

The corridor was silent for a long moment, the weight of Kaelen’s words hanging in the air. Then, slowly, the Erebus Order stepped back, their expressions unreadable.

“You’ve already made your choice,” one of them said, their voice barely above a whisper. “Now you must live with it.”

And with that, they disappeared into the shadows, leaving Kaelen alone with the weight of what they had done.

The dream-echo was no longer just a force—it was a hunger, a consuming presence that fed on the truth itself. Kaelen could feel it now, pressing against their mind, whispering promises of knowledge and power. But they also felt something else—a warning, a reminder that some truths were too dangerous to know.

And yet, they couldn’t turn back.

The city was changing, and so were they. They had seen the Sleeper, had felt its dreams and its corruption, and now, they understood what was at stake. The dream-echo wasn’t just spreading—it was evolving, growing stronger with every revelation, every whisper of knowledge.

Kaelen needed to find Lira, to understand what they had seen, what they had felt. But as they turned to leave the corridor, a new fear settled over them—what if they were already part of the dream?

They had always known Thal’Zirath was different, but now, they understood the truth: the city wasn’t just built on a dream. It was built on a guardian, a being that had once kept the world in balance. And now, that balance was threatened.

Kaelen’s heart pounded as they moved through the city, their mind racing with the weight of what they had learned. The dream-echo was spreading, and if they didn’t stop it, everything would fall.

They needed to find Lira. Needed to understand what they had seen, what they had felt. But as they reached her study, a new realization settled over them—what if the truth wasn’t just something they had to protect. What if it was something they had to forget?

Because if they remembered too much, if they carried the truth with them, they might lose themselves in it.

Kaelen stood at the threshold of Lira’s study, their breath shallow. They had come seeking answers, but now, they were faced with a choice that could change everything.

If I forget… will I still be me?

The question hung in the air, heavy with the weight of what was to come. Kaelen knew that some truths were too dangerous to know. And yet, they also knew that some truths were worth the risk.

Because without them, the city would fall. And with them, Kaelen might lose everything.

They took a deep breath, steadying themselves. The time for questions was over. It was time to make a choice.

And so, they stepped forward, into the unknown, carrying the weight of the truth with them.
