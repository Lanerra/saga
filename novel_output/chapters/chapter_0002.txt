The apartment was a cavern of cold steel and flickering holo-screens, a place where silence held more weight than words. The air smelled faintly of burnt circuitry and the sterile tang of old data cells, an aroma that clung to the walls like a whisper from the past. Sága sat in the center of it all, her chair creaking under the pressure of her thoughts as she stared into the glow of the Memory Exchange’s terminal, its interface alive with streams of information too vast to comprehend. This place had once felt like home—a sanctuary where she could process the memories of others and feel a strange sense of purpose, even if it was built on something she now found deeply unsettling.

She had returned from her meeting with Kael in silence, but it wasn’t the kind of silence that came from being alone. It was the kind that followed you, pressing against your ribs like a phantom presence. He had spoken in riddles before, his words wrapped in layers of implication and caution, but now she knew he had been hiding something much worse than she could have ever imagined. The Guilds weren’t just extracting memories. They were erasing people.

The thought made her fingers tremble as she typed, not from fear, but from a kind of desperate hope that maybe, just maybe, she was wrong. She needed to be sure. To see the truth for herself.

She leaned back in her chair and let her eyes drift across the holo-screens, each one displaying a different memory log, a different life being traded away. It had always been this way—people coming in with their most cherished moments, selling them off for more time, more stability, more of everything they wanted to keep. But now, she saw it differently. She saw the hollowing out of souls, the quiet violence of identity stripped down to numbers and codes.

The Memory Exchange had always been a place of transaction, of barter with the past. But what if it was also a place of erasure? What if every time someone walked in with a memory, they were leaving something behind that could never be reclaimed?

Her breath caught as she scrolled through the logs again, this time more deliberately, more suspiciously. She had always been good at noticing patterns, and tonight, there was one that gnawed at her: a series of transactions marked as complete, yet with no record of the subject’s current status. Some entries were flagged as “processed,” others as “transferred,” but none showed where they went or what became of them.

She typed slowly, searching for any trace of Lira. Her sister had always been hesitant about the Memory Exchange, even when she needed it most. She had sold a memory once—of their mother’s voice, soft and warm in her mind—but Sága had never asked why. Now, she did.

The results were chilling. Lira’s transaction was logged as successful, but there was no follow-up. No new status, no record of her current neural state. It was as if the memory had been taken, and that was the end of it. But Sága knew better than to believe in such neat finality.

She closed her eyes for a moment, feeling the weight of the silence pressing down on her like a physical force. This wasn’t just about power or wealth. It was about control. About rewriting who people were so that they would never remember what had been taken from them.

*If they’re erasing souls, where do those memories go?*

The question had haunted her since she first met Kael and saw the cracks in the system. Now it felt like a blade at her throat, sharp and unrelenting. She needed answers. But more than that, she needed proof. Something undeniable. A memory so clear, so raw, that even the Guilds couldn’t erase its truth.

Her fingers moved with renewed urgency across the keyboard, diving deeper into the system’s archives. The Memory Exchange was built on layers—each level more restricted than the last, each access point guarded by a different kind of fear. But Sága had spent years navigating these depths, and she knew how to find what others wanted hidden.

It wasn’t long before she stumbled upon it: a folder buried beneath the main transaction logs, marked with a red seal that only appeared when she initiated a search for restricted files. *Restricted: Guild Internal Use Only.* The name sent a jolt through her system, not of fear, but of certainty. This was what she had been looking for.

She opened it with a single keystroke, and the screen flickered as the data loaded—memories that didn’t belong to anyone listed in the database. They were real, vivid, and full of life. But there was no owner, no transaction record, no indication that they had ever come from a person who still existed.

Sága leaned closer, her breath shallow as she scanned the logs. One memory stood out: a child laughing in the arms of their parents, the sound pure and unfiltered. Another was of a woman crying at a grave, her hands trembling with grief. These weren’t just random memories. They were pieces of lives that had been torn apart.

*These memories don’t belong to anyone listed.*

The words echoed in her mind like a warning. She felt the cold sweat forming on her brow, the weight of something far greater than she had ever imagined pressing down on her. What if this folder was just the beginning? What if these were only the first of many?

She didn’t sleep that night. Instead, she sat in the dim glow of her apartment, surrounded by the hum of machines and the flicker of data streams that no longer felt like records of human experience, but rather a silent catalog of disappearances.

The next morning, Sága found herself standing in the maintenance chamber beneath the Memory Exchange hub, the air thick with the scent of ozone and the distant hiss of coolant systems. The walls were lined with rusted conduits, their surfaces slick with condensation, and the flickering lights cast long, jagged shadows across the floor. It was a place where the system’s lifeblood pulsed through unseen veins, and where people like Kael had spent years keeping it alive.

He was already there, hunched over a console that glowed faintly in the dimness of the room. His neural siphon headset still clung to his temples, its wires snaking down his neck like a parasite. He looked up when she entered, his expression unreadable behind the haze of the device. For a moment, he seemed almost relieved to see her.

“You found it, didn’t you?” he asked, his voice low, as if even here, beneath the city, they could still be overheard.

Sága didn’t answer immediately. She stepped closer, placing a data chip on the table between them. “These memories don’t belong to anyone listed,” she said, her words sharp and deliberate. “You knew this was happening, didn’t you?”

Kael hesitated. His fingers twitched slightly over the console, as if he were weighing whether to deny it or to tell her what she already suspected. Finally, he exhaled slowly and met her gaze. “I suspected,” he admitted. “But I never wanted to know for sure.”

She crossed her arms, the motion stiff with tension. “They don’t just erase. They rewrite.”

Kael’s expression darkened. “You think you’re ready for that?”

Sága stepped forward, her voice rising slightly. “I’ve already seen enough. You told me the Guilds were erasing parts of people’s identities. That they could take more than just memories. But this—this is something else. Something worse.”

Kael looked away, his jaw tightening. “They’re not just controlling lives—they’re rewriting history,” he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. “And once you look too closely, they’ll know.”

She bristled at his words. “I’m already in over my head. What are you afraid of?”

He didn’t answer directly. Instead, he tapped the console, bringing up a new window that displayed a string of names—people who had disappeared from the records, their memory logs still active but their identities erased. The list was long, and Sága’s stomach twisted at the sight of it.

“They’re not just hiding memories,” Kael said, his voice trembling slightly. “They’re erasing people.”

Sága felt her pulse quicken. The realization hit her like a slap. She wasn’t just uncovering corruption in the system—she was finding proof of something far more sinister. Something that had been going on for years.

But she didn’t back down. Instead, she leaned against the table, eyes locked on his. “Then why do you still work for them?”

Kael’s jaw tightened. “Because I don’t have a choice.”

She scoffed, her voice laced with something between anger and pity. “That’s not true. You always have a choice. Just like I do now.”

He didn’t argue. Instead, he looked at her, and in that moment, she saw the weight of his silence. The fear that had kept him from speaking out. And for the first time, she felt something she hadn’t expected—sympathy.

But sympathy wasn’t enough. Not anymore.

That night, Sága sat alone in her apartment, the holo-screens flickering with the data she had downloaded onto a personal drive. The room was dim, lit only by the single lamp on her desk, its light casting jagged shadows across the walls and the floor. She had spent hours poring over the files, each one feeling like a ghost reaching out to her.

*These memories… they’re not just being erased—they’re being buried.*

She could feel the enormity of it pressing down on her, but she didn’t stop. Her hands moved quickly over the console, extracting patterns from the chaos. There were overlaps—memories that seemed to come from the same person, yet had no owner. Some were even duplicates, as if someone had tried to overwrite the original.

If she could prove this, maybe she could stop it.

But the thought came with a new unease. What would happen if she did? Would the Guilds simply tighten their grip, erase her too? Or worse—would they use her against others?

She shook her head, trying to dispel the doubt. The system had already taken too much from her. She couldn’t turn back now.

The holo-display flickered as she pulled up a memory fragment. It was unlike the others—this one wasn’t just data, it was vivid. She could almost feel the heat of the sun on her skin, hear the screams of people vanishing in front of her eyes. It was a mass erasure event, recorded in raw, unfiltered detail.

They weren’t just stealing memories. They were wiping entire lives from existence.

Her breath came shallow and quick, her hands gripping the edge of the console. She had always known that the system required sacrifices, but this wasn’t just about time or identity. This was about control. About rewriting the past to shape the future.

*This isn’t just about power… it’s about control.*

She closed her eyes for a moment, letting the weight of it settle in her chest. The cost of power—of survival—was not just what you gave up. It was what you became when you no longer had any choice but to give.

Sága didn’t sleep that night. She spent hours mapping out the data, cross-referencing it with the Memory Exchange logs, and finally, she found something that made her blood run cold again—*The Archive Vaults.*

She stared at the words for a long time, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. The Vault was supposed to be a myth, a place where the most valuable memories were stored. But if these unaccounted memories were being hidden there, then it wasn’t just storage—it was something far more dangerous.

*If they’re keeping these memories… maybe they’re using them.*

She didn’t know why she thought that, but the idea took root in her mind. The Guilds had always been secretive about the Vaults. Access was forbidden to all but the highest-ranking members. And if those were the only ones who could enter, it meant that the truth was being guarded like a god’s secret.

She needed to know more. She needed to get inside.

The next day, she returned to the Memory Exchange and into the dusty archive room where old schematics and access logs were kept. The air smelled of dust and decay, but Sága barely noticed. Her mind was elsewhere, focused on the blueprints that detailed the structure of the Archive Vaults.

She traced her fingers over the paper, feeling the rough texture as if it might hold the answers she sought. There were hidden access points—maintenance tunnels, data conduits, backdoors that only the most skilled traders would know about. She had spent enough time in this system to understand how it worked. And now, she had a plan.

*This is how it starts—small acts of defiance.*

But even as she mapped out her route, she felt the weight of what she was doing. The Memory Exchange wasn’t just a place of work—it was a symbol of control, of the city’s dependence on the Guilds’ ruthless system. She had always moved through its halls like a ghost, unnoticed and compliant. Now, she was becoming something else.

A threat.

She left the archive room with the blueprints tucked safely in her coat, the sound of the system’s hum fading behind her. The streets of Eterna Prime were lined with memory-lamps, glowing faintly with the lives of others. She passed them without looking, her mind already set on the next step.

Her destination was the Hollow Expanse.

It wasn’t a place she wanted to go. It was where people who had lost too much went to wander in silence, their identities stripped away by the system’s relentless hunger. She had seen them before—figures moving like shadows, their eyes vacant, their voices flat and lifeless. They were the Forgotten, the ones who had traded everything for a few more years.

But she needed help. Someone who might know what she was looking for.

She found Mira in an old dwelling on the edge of the Expanse, a place that reeked of neglect and silence. The air was thick with the scent of rust and old circuitry, and the only light came from flickering holograms that projected images of memories long lost.

Mira looked up as Sága entered, her eyes sharp despite the hollowness around them. She had once been a memory trader like Sága, but now she lived on the outskirts, far from the system’s reach. Her hands were stained with grease and dust, and there was a look of resignation in her gaze.

“You should’ve stayed out of this,” Mira said without preamble, her voice rough from years of silence and smoke.

Sága sat across from her, the data drive resting between them. “I had to know.”

Mira exhaled sharply, rubbing her temples as if she were trying to remember something painful. “They don’t just erase memories,” she said finally. “They erase people. You think you’re fighting for their pasts, but they’re fighting for their futures.”

Sága felt a chill run down her spine. She had suspected this, but hearing it from someone who had walked the same path made it real in a way that no data could. Mira wasn’t just warning her—she was telling her what she had already learned, and more.

“What’s in the Vaults?” Sága asked, her voice steady despite the fear curling in her chest.

Mira looked at her then, something like pity in her eyes. “They’re not just for storage,” she said. “They’re where they take the most valuable memories and use them to feed the city’s artificial intelligence. To control it.”

Sága’s heart pounded. The Memory Exchange was more than a marketplace—it was a machine of control, its gears turning on the backs of those who had nothing left to give.

She looked down at the data drive in her hands. “Then I’ll fight for both,” she said quietly.

Mira didn’t answer. She just nodded, as if she had already heard that from someone else, long ago.

Sága left the Hollow Expanse with more than just a plan. She left with a purpose.

That night, she returned to her apartment, the blueprints spread across her desk and the data drive plugged into the terminal. She worked through the night, mapping out every possible route into the Vaults, every access point that might be left open by the system’s own negligence.

She didn’t sleep. She couldn’t.

Her mind was filled with the faces of those who had been erased, the echoes of their voices trapped in the data she had uncovered. Each memory she reviewed felt like a piece of herself being taken away, even as she held onto it for others.

*Small acts of defiance.*

She didn’t know how deep this rabbit hole went, but she was ready to follow it all the way down. The Memory Guilds had built their empire on the backs of the people they claimed to serve. But Sága wasn’t going to be one of them anymore.

She was going to find the truth.

And then, she would decide what to do with it.

The apartment felt colder now, its sterile hum more oppressive than ever before. She had always known that this place was a tomb for the pasts of others, but tonight, she saw it for what it truly was—a prison for the lives they had stolen. The holo-screens flickered with data, but each one felt like a warning.

She closed her eyes, trying to steady her breathing, but the images from the memory logs kept flashing in her mind: the child laughing, the woman crying, the faces of people who had disappeared without a trace. She could hear their voices now, not just as echoes in data, but as something deeper—something that demanded to be remembered.

She opened the drive again, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. The files were vast, each one a window into a life that had been taken from someone else. But what if she could find more? What if she could uncover the entire truth?

Her thoughts turned to Kael, to the way he had looked at her earlier, the sorrow in his eyes. He had been afraid, but not of her. He had been afraid of what he had seen, of what he knew and couldn’t change.

She felt a pang of guilt. Had she known this all along? Had she ignored the signs, just as he had?

No. She hadn’t. Not until now.

She needed to go further. To dig deeper into the system’s secrets. To find out exactly what was being done in those hidden folders, in those unaccounted logs, in that mythical place known only as *The Archive Vaults.*

Her fingers moved with renewed determination across the keyboard, pulling up another memory fragment. This one was different—there were no clear images, just a cacophony of sounds and sensations, like a city being torn apart in the middle of the night. She could feel the heat of the crowd, the panic in their voices, the way they had been pulled into nothingness, their lives reduced to data points.

She had seen this before, without knowing it. The Guilds didn’t just erase memories—they erased people. They took them from the world and stored them away, hidden in a place that no one could reach. A place where the past was rewritten, where history itself was being manipulated by those who controlled the system.

Sága sat back in her chair, her heart pounding. The weight of it all pressed down on her, but she didn’t stop. She couldn’t.

She had spent her entire life believing in the Memory Exchange, in its purpose, in its value. But now, she saw it for what it really was—a machine of control, a system that fed on the forgotten and shaped the future with their pasts.

She had no more illusions.

She would not be a part of it.

The next morning, Sága set out for the Memory Exchange once more, her mind clear, her purpose unwavering. She passed through the streets of Eterna Prime, where people moved like ghosts, their eyes vacant and their hands gripping memory-lamps that pulsed with the lives of others. The city had always felt like a machine—cold, efficient, and unfeeling—but now she saw it for what it was: a prison built on stolen moments.

She arrived at the archive room, its door slightly ajar, as if waiting for her to come. The air inside was thick with dust, the scent of old paper and forgotten data clinging to the walls like a memory itself. She stepped inside, her boots crunching over the debris that littered the floor—broken terminals, discarded schematics, and the remnants of lives that had once been traded here.

She found what she was looking for: a stack of blueprints detailing the structure of the Memory Exchange, including its lower levels. The Archive Vaults were not just a storage facility—they were a labyrinth of data conduits, maintenance tunnels, and security barriers designed to keep anyone from getting in or out. Only the highest-ranking Guild members had access, and even they were only allowed in under strict supervision.

Sága traced her fingers over the paper, feeling the texture of it beneath her touch. The system was vast, its layers deeper than she had ever imagined. But she had spent years navigating its depths, and now, she would do it again—only this time, not as a trader, but as someone who had seen the truth.

She mapped out a route into the Vaults using the blueprints and the data she had downloaded. It was risky. The system would know if she accessed restricted areas. If she entered the Vaults, there would be no turning back. But Sága didn’t care anymore.

She had spent her life trading in memories, selling them to the highest bidder, believing that it was a way to help people. She had believed that the Memory Exchange was a place of progress, of healing. But now she knew: it was a machine of erasure, built on the backs of those who had nothing left to give.

She would not be one of them.

The plan was simple but dangerous. She would use an old maintenance tunnel, one that was rarely used and largely forgotten. It would take her deep into the heart of the Memory Exchange, where the Archive Vaults were rumored to be hidden beneath layers of security systems and false walls. If she could reach them, she might find the proof she needed.

But even as she mapped out the path, she felt the weight of the city pressing down on her. The Guilds had built this place to be unassailable, their control absolute. And yet, Sága had a choice. She had always had a choice.

She left the archive room with the blueprints tucked safely in her coat, the sound of the system’s hum fading behind her. The streets of Eterna Prime were lined with memory-lamps, glowing faintly with the lives of others. She passed them without looking, her mind already set on the next step.

Her destination was the Hollow Expanse again, but this time, she wasn’t going to ask for help. She knew what Mira had told her, and she knew that it was true. The Guilds didn’t just erase people—they used them. They fed their stolen memories into the city’s artificial intelligence, shaping its future with the pasts of those who had been lost.

She needed to go deeper than ever before, not just into the system, but into the truth it had hidden for so long.

And she would do it alone.

The next night, Sága sat in her apartment, the blueprints spread out across her desk and the data drive plugged into the terminal. The holo-screens flickered with information, each one a different memory, each one a different life that had been taken from someone else.

She worked through the night, her fingers moving over the keyboard with a precision born of desperation. She wasn’t just mapping out a route anymore—she was preparing herself for what she would find in the Vaults. For the truth that lay buried beneath layers of security and silence.

The thought made her stomach twist. The Guilds had spent years building this system, ensuring that no one could challenge it. No one could uncover its secrets. And yet, here she was—someone who had seen too much, someone who had been pushed past the point of no return.

She closed her eyes for a moment, letting the weight of it settle in her chest. The cost of power—of survival—was not just what you gave up. It was what you became when you no longer had any choice but to give.

Sága didn’t sleep that night. She couldn’t.

Her mind was filled with the faces of those who had been erased, the echoes of their voices trapped in the data she had uncovered. Each memory she reviewed felt like a piece of herself being taken away, even as she held onto it for others.

*Small acts of defiance.*

She didn’t know how deep this rabbit hole went, but she was ready to follow it all the way down. The Memory Guilds had built their empire on the backs of the people they claimed to serve. But Sága wasn’t going to be one of them anymore.

She was going to find the truth.

And then, she would decide what to do with it.
