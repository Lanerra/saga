Jax Xenobia had long since stopped looking for the past. He’d buried it beneath layers of dust and regret, hidden in the quiet corners of his antique shop where time moved slower than anywhere else. The Hourglass Curios was more than a place—it was a refuge, a prison, a sanctuary. It was the only thing left that felt like home after everything else had been erased, rewritten, or simply gone.

The lamp above him flickered, casting long shadows across the wooden floorboards. He sat in his usual corner, surrounded by relics from every known timeline, each one holding a fragment of history that had been lost, altered, or forgotten. The shop smelled of old paper and ozone, like the air inside a forgotten cathedral. It was a place where time didn’t just pass—it lingered.

He ran a hand over the surface of an ornate pocket watch, its brass tarnished, its face cracked in half. He had found it years ago, buried in a crate of salvaged tech from the Temporal Concord’s ruins. He never knew what it was, and he never asked. It just sat there, like a silent companion, until now.

The faint shimmer had been there for days. At first, he thought it was his imagination—perhaps the dust was catching the light in an odd way. But tonight, as he leaned closer, the glow seemed to pulse with something more. He brushed away the layers of dust with careful fingers, the sound of metal scraping against metal echoing in the stillness.

There, beneath the watch’s inner workings, was a small compartment. Not just any compartment—its edges were etched with strange symbols, ones he hadn’t seen before. They looked like they belonged to something older than time itself, as if they had been waiting for him to find them.

His breath caught in his throat. He hadn’t expected this. Not again.

He reached inside and pulled out a small, unassuming device. He had long since stopped looking for the past.

His breath caught in his throat. He hadn’t expected this. Not again.

He reached inside and pulled out a small, unassuming device. It was no larger than a pocket watch, but its surface shimmered with a faint, golden light, like the sun through a stained-glass window. The edges were smooth, almost too smooth, and the metal felt warm to the touch—something that made sense in an Eddy Reality where time had long since slowed, not stopped. The warmth was a whisper of movement, a flicker of possibility, a reminder that even in the slowest of times, there was still something to be found. The edges were smooth, almost too smooth, and the metal felt warm to the touch—something unnatural in an Eddy Reality where time had long since stopped moving.

Jax’s fingers trembled as he turned it over. The markings matched those on the fracture site. He had seen them before, but never quite like this. They were more intricate, almost alive with a pattern that seemed to shift when he wasn’t looking.

“This shouldn’t be here,” he muttered, his voice barely above a whisper. “Not anymore.”

He set the device down on the counter, its surface gleaming under the golden light. The shop had always been still, but now it felt like something was waiting for him. He could almost hear it—like a heartbeat in the silence.

He didn’t know what to do with it. It wasn’t just any artifact; it was something else entirely. Something that shouldn’t exist. And yet, here it was, in his hands, as if it had been placed there by fate or some unseen force.

He looked around the shop, half-expecting to see someone watching him. But the only presence was his own. The air felt heavier, like he was standing on the edge of a precipice, looking down at a world that no longer belonged to him.

Jax exhaled slowly, trying to steady himself. He had spent years running from the echoes of his past, from the ghosts that haunted him in every moment. But this—this was different. This wasn’t just a memory. This was something real, something he couldn’t ignore.

He reached for the device again, fingers hovering above its surface. “Maybe it’s a mistake,” he said to himself. “Or maybe it's waiting for me.”

The shop seemed to hold its breath. The air around him grew thick, almost electric. He could feel the weight of his own thoughts pressing down on him, like an unseen hand trying to push him away.

But he wasn’t going anywhere. Not yet.

He placed the device on the counter and turned it over once more, studying the symbols with a mix of fascination and dread. If this was part of the fracture’s aftermath, then what did it mean? What had he missed?

The thought sent a chill through him. He had always believed that the Great Timeline Fracture was an accident. A mistake he couldn’t undo. But now, something in his gut told him otherwise.

He had been wrong before. And he might be wrong again.

The moment he touched the device, the shop shuddered. The air shifted, and for a split second, everything around him seemed to blur.

The moment he touched the device, the shop shuddered. The air shifted, and for a split second, everything around him seemed to blur. The golden light from the lamp dimmed, then flared back with a sudden brightness that made his eyes water. But in this reality, light didn’t behave that way. It was static, unchanging. The only thing that could explain the flare was the device itself—something that defied the rules of the Eddy Reality, pulsing with energy that hadn't been there before.Then, the world changed.

The shop was gone. In its place stood the same room he had been in moments ago, but now it felt different—more vivid, more real. The walls were still the same shade of brown, the floorboards creaked underfoot like they always had. But there was a presence here, something that didn’t belong.

A woman stood in the center of the room, her back to him. She was tall, with dark hair tied back in a loose braid and eyes that gleamed with an intensity he hadn’t seen in years. Her coat was frayed at the edges, but it looked clean, as if she had just stepped out of a time that still ran smoothly.

Lila.

He didn’t move. His breath came shallow, his pulse quickening. He could feel the weight of her presence, the way she seemed to exist just beyond the edges of reality. She was not a ghost, not a memory. She was real—something he had not expected to see again.

“Jax,” she said, her voice low and steady. “You shouldn’t be here.”

He felt something inside him crack. Not in the way it had before—this wasn’t just the pain of memory. This was real. The echo was more than a vision; it was a presence, a reminder that he had left something behind.

He didn’t move. His breath came shallow, his pulse quickening. She turned slowly, and for a moment, the world seemed to pause.

“Jax,” she said, her voice low and steady. “You shouldn’t be here.”

He felt something inside him crack. Not in the way it had before—this wasn’t just the pain of memory. This was real. The echo was more than a vision; it was a presence, a reminder that he had left something behind.

“I thought I left all of this behind,” he said, his voice barely audible. “I thought I could forget.”

Lila stepped closer, her expression unreadable. She looked like she always had, but there was something different in the way she carried herself. Like she knew more than she should, or like she had been waiting for him.

“Why are you here?” he asked, his voice trembling. “You were supposed to be gone.”

She didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she looked around the room, as if searching for something—or someone. Her gaze landed on the device in his hands, and her eyes widened slightly.

“This isn’t how it happened,” she said. “I remember differently.”

Jax’s stomach twisted. He had spent so long trying to convince himself that he had done everything right, that the fracture was an accident, that he wasn’t responsible for anything more than a single moment. But Lila’s words cut through that illusion like a blade.

“What do you mean?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

She took a step back, her expression darkening. “You don’t remember what happened, do you?”

He didn’t. He had no idea. All he knew was that the fracture had taken everything from him—his life, his purpose, and Lila. She had been his partner, his friend, and then she was gone, like a candle snuffed out in the wind.

“I remember it,” he said, forcing himself to meet her eyes. “I remember what I did.”

Lila shook her head. “You don’t. Not really. You’ve been told what happened. But this—this is the truth.”

She reached out, her fingers brushing against his arm. The touch sent a jolt through him, like a current running through his bones.

“I’m not sure if I did this,” he said, his voice thick with uncertainty. “Or if it’s just another lie.”

Lila’s eyes softened, but there was something else in them—something that made Jax feel like he was standing on the precipice of a decision he wasn’t ready to make.

“I’m not here to tell you what to do,” she said. “But I am here to remind you that you have a choice. And that you’ve been trying to run from it for too long.”

The golden light around them began to flicker, and Jax felt the world pulling him back. The shop, the dust, the stillness—it all returned in a rush, like a wave crashing against the shore.

He stumbled backward, his hand gripping the device tightly. “I thought I left all of this behind,” he repeated, more to himself than to her. “I thought I could forget.”

Lila’s eyes met his once more. “You can’t. Not really.”

And then she was gone.

The shop returned to its familiar state, the air thick with dust and silence. Jax stood there, staring at the device in his hands, his heart pounding like it had been caught in a storm.

He didn’t know what to think. He hadn’t expected Lila to show up again—not like this. Not in a way that felt so real. He had spent years trying to move on, to forget, but now the past was knocking at his door once more.

He set the device down and rubbed his temples, trying to steady his thoughts. “Maybe it’s a mistake,” he said aloud, almost to himself. “Or maybe it's waiting for me.”

But as he looked around the shop again, he realized that wasn’t true. It had been waiting for him all along. He just hadn’t been ready to see it.

---

Jax didn’t sleep that night. The device sat on his desk, its golden light casting strange shadows across the walls. He couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching him—something that wanted him to remember. To understand. To act.

He spent hours poring over old blueprints and faded notes, pieces of history he had never thought to look at again. The shop had always been a place of quiet, but now it felt like a prison. He had no choice but to dig deeper, to find the truth that had been hidden from him for so long.

The notes were scattered across the shop, tucked into corners and drawers, as if they had been waiting for someone to find them. Some were written in languages he didn’t recognize, others in careful, precise script that seemed to belong to a time before his own. But one set of markings caught his eye—those same symbols from the fracture site.

He traced them with his finger, feeling their weight against his skin. “These markings... they match the ones I saw on the fracture site,” he muttered, more to himself than anyone else. “They’re part of something bigger.”

His mind raced. If these notes were connected to the device, then what did they mean? What had happened in the Great Timeline Fracture that he wasn’t supposed to remember?

He pulled out a notebook, its pages brittle with age, and began flipping through them. The words were jumbled, some of them blurred by time or decay, but there was a pattern—repeated symbols, repeated phrases, all pointing toward something he had never been told.

“This isn’t how it happened,” one page read, the ink faded but still legible. “He doesn’t remember. But he should.”

Jax’s breath caught in his throat. He had heard those words before, spoken by someone who had once been close to him. Someone who had vanished without a trace.

He looked up at the device, its golden light pulsing like a heartbeat. “If this device is part of something bigger,” he said, almost to himself, “then maybe I’m not the only one who remembers.”

He reached for the device again, his fingers trembling. He needed answers. And if he couldn’t find them on his own, then he would have to go to someone who could.

Dr. Varen Kael.

The name had been on his lips for weeks now, a whisper in the back of his mind that refused to fade. He had heard of Kael before—once, during his time with the Concord. A man who had vanished after the fracture, leaving behind only rumors and half-truths.

But Jax had no choice. If he was going to understand what had happened, if he was going to face the truth about Lila and the fracture, then he would have to find Kael.

He packed his bag with supplies: a flashlight, some old schematics, and the device. He didn’t know where Kael was, but he had a feeling that the Fixer knew. The Fixer had always been one step ahead, always pulling him back into the fray when he thought he was done.

Jax left the shop just before dawn, the sun casting long shadows across the cobblestone streets of the Eddy Reality. He hadn’t realized how much he had missed the world until now. It felt like a dream, like something from another life.

The Fixer found him at the edge of town, standing in front of an old clock tower that had been abandoned for years. The air was thick with the scent of rain and rust, and Jax could feel the weight of time pressing down on him.

“You’re not ready,” The Fixer said, their voice a low murmur that seemed to come from everywhere at once. “But you’re already moving.”

Jax didn’t answer immediately. He wasn’t sure what to say. He had been running for so long, trying to forget, trying to move on. But now, the past was catching up with him.

“I thought I left all of this behind,” he said finally, his voice quiet but steady.

The Fixer tilted their head, as if considering his words. “You didn’t. You just buried it.”

Jax looked at them, searching for something—some sign that they understood the weight of what he was about to do. But The Fixer only smiled, a cryptic expression that sent a shiver down his spine.

“You’re not just a relic,” they said. “You’re a key.”

He didn’t understand what that meant. But he knew one thing: he couldn’t ignore it anymore. Not when the echoes were growing stronger, when the truth was slipping through his fingers like sand.

“I need to know the truth,” he said. “Even if it hurts.”

The Fixer nodded slowly, their eyes gleaming with something he couldn’t quite place. “Then come with me.”

---

Dr. Varen Kael’s underground lab was a place of contradictions. It was a relic from the Temporal Concord, a structure that had once been part of the great crystalline city of temporal_hub_prime. Now, it was a forgotten place, buried beneath layers of time and neglect.

The lab was dimly lit, with flickering holograms casting eerie shadows across the walls. The air was thick with the scent of ozone and old metal. Jax had expected something more sterile, more clinical—but this place felt alive, like it had been waiting for him.

Kael stood in the center of the room, their back to him as they adjusted a console filled with blinking terminals and floating data streams. There were no walls, only shifting panels of light and information that seemed to move on their own.

“Jax,” Kael said without turning. “I wasn’t sure you’d come.”

He stepped forward, his heart pounding. “You didn’t think I would?”

Kael finally turned, their face lined with years of secrets and regret. “No. But I knew you would eventually.”

Jax looked at the device in his hands, its golden light still pulsing faintly. “What is it?”

Kael’s eyes narrowed slightly. “That depends. What do you think it is?”

Jax hesitated. “I think it’s something that shouldn’t exist. Something that was meant to be lost.”

Kael nodded slowly. “Then you’re right. But not for the reasons you think.”

They gestured toward a panel of light, which flickered and then settled into a clear image—of the Great Timeline Fracture.

Jax’s breath caught in his throat. He had seen this before, in fragments, in echoes. But now, it was whole.

“This is the fracture,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “This is what I did.”

Kael shook their head. “You didn’t do this. Not exactly. The fracture wasn’t an accident. It was deliberate.”

Jax felt his stomach twist again. “What are you talking about?”

Kael stepped closer, their expression unreadable. “It was a test. A way to see if you were strong enough to face the truth. If you could resist the echoes and remember what really happened.”

He looked at them, his mind racing. “You’re saying I wasn’t the cause of the fracture?”

Kael’s eyes met his. “No. You were part of it. But not in the way you think.”

Jax felt a cold wave of realization wash over him. He had spent so long blaming himself, thinking that he had been the one to break the timeline. But what if that wasn’t true? What if the fracture was something bigger, something he hadn’t been told?

He looked down at the device again, its golden light pulsing like a heartbeat. “Then who was it?”

Kael’s voice dropped. “Cohort Zero.”

Jax’s eyes widened. “They’re the ones trying to erase me?”

Kael nodded. “They see you as a threat. Your ability to perceive echoes makes you dangerous in their eyes. You could expose their plans, their lies.”

He felt a flicker of anger, but it was quickly replaced by something else—something deeper. Doubt.

“I don’t understand,” he said. “Why would they target me?”

Kael’s expression darkened. “Because you were the last piece of the puzzle. The only one who could see the echoes and remember what was lost.”

Jax exhaled slowly, his thoughts a storm of confusion and fear. “So I’m not just a relic. I’m a key.”

Kael nodded. “And that means you can’t run from this anymore.”

He looked at them, searching for something—some reassurance. But Kael only offered silence.

“I need to know the truth,” Jax said again, more resolute now. “Even if it hurts.”

Kael studied him for a long moment, then reached out and took the device from his hands. “Then let’s start with that.”

They began analyzing the device, their fingers moving over the console with practiced ease. The data streams swirled around them, forming images of timelines, of events, of people who had been lost to time.

“This network,” Kael said, their voice steady but laced with something like urgency, “is part of a larger system. A way for Cohort Zero to track the echoes and determine which ones are real.”

Jax’s mind reeled. “So they’re using this device to find me?”

Kael shook their head. “Not just you. They’re using it to find others who can see the echoes. People like you, people who remember what was lost.”

He felt a chill run through him. “And what do they plan to do with it?”

Kael’s voice dropped. “They want to control the past. To rewrite it. To make sure no one remembers what was taken away from them.”

Jax’s chest tightened. He had always known that Cohort Zero wanted to impose order on time, but he hadn’t realized how far they were willing to go. How many lives they were willing to erase.

“They’re not just rewriting history,” Kael continued, their voice barely above a whisper. “They’re erasing it. And if you don’t stop them, they’ll do it to everyone.”

Jax clenched his fists. “Then I have to stop them.”

Kael looked at him, something like pride in their eyes. “You already are.”

He didn’t understand what that meant, but he knew one thing: the past was no longer a ghost. It was a force that had returned, and he couldn’t ignore it.

---

In the days that followed, Jax and Kael worked tirelessly to uncover the full scope of the network. The device wasn’t just an artifact—it was a beacon, a map, a key to something far greater than he had imagined.

They found more artifacts scattered across different timelines, each one glowing with the same golden light. Some were hidden in plain sight, buried beneath layers of history that had been rewritten. Others were lost in the chaos of the Fracture Zones, where time itself was unstable and unpredictable.

Every time Jax saw one of these devices, he felt a pang of something deep inside him—like the weight of his own guilt pressing down on him. He had spent so long believing that he was responsible for Lila’s disappearance, but now he wasn’t sure if that was true.

“Maybe I wasn’t the cause,” he said one night, staring at the device in front of him. “Maybe I just got caught in it.”

Kael looked up from their work, their expression unreadable. “You were part of it. But not in the way you think.”

Jax felt his frustration rise. “Then tell me what I did. Tell me what I’m supposed to remember.”

Kael hesitated, then pulled up a holographic display showing a series of timelines, each one branching out like the roots of a tree. Some were stable, others chaotic. One, however, stood out—a timeline that had been altered, its edges frayed and broken.

“This is the original fracture,” Kael said, their voice quiet. “Before it was rewritten.”

Jax’s eyes followed the display, his heart pounding. “And this is what happened?”

Kael nodded. “You were there. But not as the one who caused it. You were the one who saw it coming.”

He felt something inside him shift. The weight of guilt that had been pressing down on him for years began to lift, replaced by a strange sense of clarity.

“I didn’t cause it,” he said, his voice steady now. “I just saw it.”

Kael’s eyes softened. “That’s the truth. And that’s why you’re important. Because you remember what was lost.”

Jax looked at them, his mind racing. He had spent so long trying to forget, to move on, but now he realized that forgetting wasn’t an option. Not anymore.

He reached for the device again, its surface warm beneath his fingers. “Then I have to face it.”

Kael nodded. “You already are.”

And in that moment, Jax knew—he couldn’t run from this anymore. The echoes had been waiting, and now they were calling him back to the truth.

The past was no longer a burden. It was a path.

He exhaled slowly, his fingers tightening around the device. “I need to know the truth. Even if it hurts.”

Kael smiled faintly. “Then let’s find it.”
