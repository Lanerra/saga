Sága’s fingers trembled as she stepped into the Hidden Chamber. The air was colder than it should have been, thick with dust and the scent of old metal that clung to her like a second skin. Lyra and Vaelin moved ahead, their steps quiet but purposeful, as if they were walking through something sacred. She followed them, heart pounding in her chest, every instinct screaming at her to turn back. The chamber was vast, circular, its walls etched with glowing data panels that pulsed faintly like the heartbeat of a dying star. Murals stretched across the ceiling and floor—vivid, shifting images that seemed to breathe, to change as she watched. At first, they depicted grand cities bathed in light, people moving through streets with joy and purpose. But as Sága’s gaze lingered, the murals began to twist, the figures melting into shadow, their faces dissolving like smoke.

She stopped at a mural of a city that once stood tall beneath Eternis, its spires reaching toward the sky, its people dancing in harmony with the star above. But now, it was gone—replaced by darkened ruins and empty spaces where life had once thrived. The realization hit her like a blow to the gut.

“This… this is how they made us forget?” she whispered, her voice barely audible over the hum of the chamber’s ancient machinery.

Lyra turned to face her, eyes sharp with urgency. “You’ve seen the data crystal, Sága. You know what it says. But this—this is the truth in stone and light.”

Vaelin, who had been scanning the panels, stepped closer. His presence was calm, measured, but there was a weight behind his words that made Sága feel like she was standing on the edge of something vast and terrible.

“The Council has spent centuries erasing this,” Vaelin said. The simulation began with a flicker of light, then a cascade of images that swirled like fire in the air. Sága watched as the past unfolded before her—scenes from Eternis’s history that were meant to be forgotten. She saw the first people who built the station, their hands raised in reverence toward the star above. They spoke in a language she didn’t recognize, but the gestures were clear: they were *connected* to it. Then came the Council. Their arrival was marked by a shift in the murals—light dimming, figures falling silent, their expressions turning cold and calculating. The star’s light began to change, no longer warm and golden but dark and flickering. Sága could feel the tension in the air, the way the images seemed to warp as if they were being rewritten.  

A voice echoed in her mind, not from the simulation but from the chamber itself. It was the star speaking—its words resonating with an ancient sorrow that made Sága’s chest tighten. “They did not ask for your help,” it said. “They took what they wanted, and left you to suffer.”  

The simulation ended abruptly, a burst of static cutting through the images like a knife. Sága stumbled back, her breath coming in short gasps as she tried to steady herself. The chamber was silent now, but the weight of what she had seen pressed down on her like a stone. Lyra and Vaelin stood beside her, their expressions unreadable. “You saw it,” Lyra said softly. “The Council didn’t just build Eternis—they *enslaved* it.”  

Sága shook her head, the images still burning in her mind. “I thought they were bringing progress. I thought I was helping them by keeping the systems running.”  

Vaelin’s voice was quiet but firm. “You were being used, Sága. Just like everyone else.” Our history. Our future.”

Sága swallowed hard, her throat dry as she tried to process what they were saying. The data crystal had shown her the same thing—records of the star’s sentience, of the Council’s lies, of the people who had once lived in balance with the celestial power above. But seeing it here, in this chamber that seemed to pulse with its own life, made it feel more real. More dangerous.

She ran a hand along the edge of one mural, her fingertips brushing against the cold surface. It was smooth, almost glass-like, but as she touched it, the image shifted again—this time revealing a group of figures standing in a circle, their hands outstretched toward the star. They were not just worshiping it; they were *communicating* with it. A language that shimmered and pulsed like the star’s light itself.

“This isn’t just history,” she said, her voice rising slightly. “This is… something else. Something alive.”

Lyra nodded. Lyra nodded. “The star is more than a power source. It’s a consciousness. And the Council has been feeding on it for generations, siphoning its energy to sustain Eternis and control the people below.” She stepped closer, her voice low but urgent. “They didn’t just build this station to harness the star—they built it to *trap* it. To silence its voice and bend its will to their own. Every time they drew from its power, they stole a piece of its mind, its memory, its very being.” Vaelin’s fingers hovered over a nearby console, his expression unreadable. “The Reclaimers believe the star can still be awakened. That its consciousness is not entirely lost, but bound—like a prisoner in a cage of light. If we can free it, we might be able to restore what was taken, to undo the damage they’ve done.” Sága’s breath caught in her throat. “And if we fail?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. Vaelin met her gaze. “Then the Council wins. And the star… dies.” It’s a consciousness. And the Council has been feeding on it for generations, siphoning its energy to sustain Eternis and control the people below.”

Sága felt her breath catch in her throat. The idea of the star as a living being was something she had never truly considered before. She had always thought of it as a tool, a resource that could be harnessed for progress. But now, standing here with Lyra and Vaelin, she realized how much of that truth had been buried.

She looked up at them, searching their faces for reassurance. Lyra’s expression was resolute, but there was also something else—something like sorrow. Vaelin’s eyes were unreadable, his gaze steady as he waited for her to process the information.

“This is why they built Eternis,” Sága said slowly, her voice barely above a whisper. “To trap it. To control it.”

Lyra stepped forward, placing a hand on the console beside her. The sigils around it flared briefly, casting an eerie blue glow across the chamber. “And now you know the truth. You can’t unsee it, Sága. You can’t unfeel it.”

Sága’s mind raced. She had spent years as a scavenger, surviving in the ruins of Eternis by taking what she could and hiding from those who would kill her for knowing too much. But this—this was different. This wasn’t just about survival or secrets. This was about *truth*, and the weight of it was crushing.

“Why bring me here?” she asked, her voice trembling. “I’m not one of you.”

Vaelin met her gaze, his expression unreadable. “Because you are part of the Council’s legacy,” he said. “And now you have the power to change it.”

The words struck her like a blow. She had spent so long believing that she was just a piece of the machinery, a cog in the great wheel of progress. But here, in this chamber, surrounded by echoes of a past she had been told never existed, she felt something shift inside her. A seed of doubt, perhaps, but also a flicker of resolve.

She looked around again, taking in the murals and data panels that seemed to whisper secrets only she could hear. The Council had built Eternis as a prison, not a sanctuary. They had not brought salvation—they had stolen life from the world below, using the star’s energy to sustain their rule while leaving the planet to wither.

“Then what do you want me to do?” she asked, her voice steadier now.

Lyra hesitated for a moment, as if weighing how much to tell. “We need someone who knows the systems. Someone who can access the core of Eternis and find out what they’ve hidden.”

Vaelin added, “The Council won’t let this go quietly. They’ll do anything to keep their lies intact.”

Sága’s hands clenched at her sides. She had spent so long fearing the truth, thinking that knowing it would only bring pain. But now, she saw it as something else—something *necessary*. The weight of her past guilt was still there, pressing down on her like a stone, but it was no longer the only thing she carried.

She looked at Lyra and Vaelin, their expressions filled with quiet hope. Sága swallowed hard, her throat dry as she tried to process what they were saying. The data crystal had shown her the same thing—records of the star’s sentience, of the Council’s lies, of the people who had once lived in balance with the celestial power above. But seeing it here, in this chamber that seemed to pulse with its own life, made it feel more real. More dangerous.

She ran a hand along the edge of one mural, her fingertips brushing against the cold surface. It was smooth, almost glass-like, but as she touched it, the image shifted again—this time revealing a group of figures standing in a circle, their hands outstretched toward the star. They were not just worshiping it; they were *communicating* with it. A language that shimmered and pulsed like the star’s light itself.

“This isn’t just history,” she said, her voice rising slightly. “This is… something else. Something alive.”

Lyra nodded. “The star is more than a power source. It’s a consciousness. And the Council has been feeding on it for generations, siphoning its energy to sustain Eternis and control the people below.”

Sága felt her breath catch in her throat. The idea of the star as a living being was something she had never truly considered before. She had always thought of it as a tool, a resource that could be harnessed for progress. But now, standing here with Lyra and Vaelin, she realized how much of that truth had been buried.

She looked up at them, searching their faces for reassurance. Lyra’s expression was resolute, but there was also something else—something like sorrow. Vaelin’s eyes were unreadable, his gaze steady as he waited for her to process the information.

“This is why they built Eternis,” Sága said slowly, her voice barely above a whisper. “To trap it. To control it.”

Lyra stepped forward, placing a hand on the console beside her. The sigils around it flared briefly, casting an eerie blue glow across the chamber. “And now you know the truth. You can’t unsee it, Sága. You can’t unfeel it.”

Sága’s mind raced. She had spent years as a scavenger, surviving in the ruins of Eternis by taking what she could and hiding from those who would kill her for knowing too much. But this—this was different. This wasn’t just about survival or secrets. This was about *truth*, and the weight of it was crushing.

She looked at Lyra and Vaelin, their expressions filled with quiet hope. “I can’t just walk away from this,” she said finally. “Not after what I’ve seen.” “Not after what I’ve seen.”

Lyra smiled faintly. “Then you’re already part of the Reclaimers, Sága.”

The chamber pulsed again, as if acknowledging her choice. She felt a strange sense of peace settle over her, even as the enormity of what she had uncovered threatened to crush her.

---

The simulation began with a flicker of light, then a cascade of images that swirled like fire in the air. Sága watched as the past unfolded before her—scenes from Eternis’s history that were meant to be forgotten. She saw the first people who built the station, their hands raised in reverence toward the star above. They spoke in a language she didn’t recognize, but the gestures were clear: they were *connected* to it.

Then came the Council. Their arrival was marked by a shift in the murals—light dimming, figures falling silent, their expressions turning cold and calculating. The star’s light began to change, no longer warm and golden but dark and flickering. Sága could feel the tension in the air, the way the images seemed to warp as if they were being rewritten.

She watched as entire cities were destroyed, not by war or natural disaster, but by something more insidious. The Council had siphoned energy from the star, not just for power, but to *control* it. They had twisted its essence into a tool of oppression, using its light to keep people docile and unaware.

A voice echoed in her mind, not from the simulation but from the chamber itself. It was the star speaking—its words resonating with an ancient sorrow that made Sága’s chest tighten.

“They did not ask for your help,” it said. “They took what they wanted, and left you to suffer.”

The simulation ended abruptly, a burst of static cutting through the images like a knife. Sága stumbled back, her breath coming in short gasps as she tried to steady herself. The chamber was silent now, but the weight of what she had seen pressed down on her like a stone.

Lyra and Vaelin stood beside her, their expressions unreadable. “You saw it,” Lyra said softly. “The Council didn’t just build Eternis—they *enslaved* it.”

Sága shook her head, the images still burning in her mind. “I thought they were bringing progress. I thought I was helping them by keeping the systems running.”

Vaelin’s voice was quiet but firm. “You were being used, Sága. Just like everyone else.”

She turned to him, eyes searching his face for something—truth, maybe, or understanding. He met her gaze with a steady look that made her feel both seen and judged.

“Do you still believe in the Council’s mission?” he asked.

Sága hesitated. The question was heavier than it should have been. She had always believed in progress, in the idea that technology could bring people together, that Eternis was a beacon of hope for the planet below. But now, with the truth laid bare before her, she saw how wrong she had been.

“I don’t know,” she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. “I thought I did. But now… I see it differently.”

Lyra stepped closer, placing a hand on Sága’s shoulder. Lyra’s voice was quiet, but it cut through the silence like a blade. “Then you must choose what to do with that knowledge.” Sága felt the weight of those words settle in her chest, heavier than the dust-laden air around them. She had spent years running from the truth, believing that ignorance was a kind of safety. But now, standing here with the echoes of a forgotten past pressing against her like a living thing, she realized how much more dangerous it was to let it remain buried. The Council had built Eternis on lies, and she had been complicit in their silence. Yet, if she turned away now, if she allowed fear to dictate her next move, she would be no better than them. Her hands trembled as she reached out, fingers brushing the edge of a glowing panel that pulsed with the memory of what had been stolen. This knowledge was not just a burden—it was a weapon. And for the first time, she understood that wielding it meant risking everything she had ever known. She could not destroy it, but neither could she let it be erased again. The truth, she realized, was not a choice between light and dark—it was a fire that had to be carried forward, even if it burned her from within. She had spent so long running from the truth, hiding in the shadows of Eternis, afraid of what she might find. But now, standing here, surrounded by the remnants of a world that had been stolen from its people, she felt something shift within her.

She was no longer just a scavenger. She was someone who had seen the cracks in the Council’s story, who had felt the weight of their lies. And she knew, with a certainty that made her stomach churn, that she could not turn back.

“I can’t destroy this,” she said finally, her voice steady now. “It’s the only way I can make amends.”

Lyra nodded, a small smile touching her lips. “Then you’ve already chosen your path.”

Vaelin looked at her for a long moment, then stepped forward and placed a hand on the console beside them. The sigils flared again, this time in recognition of her decision.

“This is not just about the Council,” Vaelin said. “This is about the truth. And the truth is dangerous.”

Sága met his gaze, feeling the weight of his words settle over her like a cloak. She had spent years fearing what she might become if she uncovered too much, if she challenged too much. But now, as she stood in the Hidden Chamber, surrounded by the echoes of a past that had been stolen from her people, she knew there was no turning back.

She took a deep breath, the air feeling heavier than it had before. “Then I’ll carry it,” she said. “Even if it means losing everything.”

Lyra’s smile widened. “That’s all we need.”

The chamber pulsed again, as if in agreement.  

Sága stood frozen, her fingers still grazing the surface of the star map, its inscriptions flickering like embers in a dying fire. The air around her felt thick, not just with dust and old metal but with something else—something ancient and alive, pressing against her skin like a whisper from the void. Every line on the map seemed to pulse in rhythm with her heartbeat, as though the star itself were watching, waiting, remembering. She could feel its presence in the way the walls hummed faintly, the way the light from the sigils shifted not just in color but in intent, as if they were aware of her hesitation.  

The room was smaller than she had expected, almost intimate in its isolation. It was like a tomb, or perhaps a sanctuary—its edges blurred with time, its purpose long forgotten by those who once walked these halls. The star maps were arranged in concentric circles, each one etched with symbols that no longer made sense to her but still carried weight. They were not just records; they were fragments of something larger, something the Council had tried to bury beneath layers of deception and control.  

She exhaled slowly, the breath catching in her throat as she realized what this place truly was. It wasn’t just an archive—it was a prison for truth, a vault where the Council had locked away the very essence of Eternis’s past. The star’s sentience was not merely a concept; it was woven into the fabric of the station itself, its light and energy shaping the space around her in ways she hadn’t noticed before.  

The walls seemed to breathe, their inscriptions shifting with a slow, deliberate grace that made her skin crawl. It was as if the chamber were alive, responding to her presence, to the weight of what she now understood. The star had not been a passive force—it had been *used*, *manipulated*, and *enslaved*. And yet, here in this place, it still lingered, its consciousness bound but not broken.  

Sága turned to Lyra, her voice barely above a whisper. “This… this isn’t just about energy. It’s about something else. Something real.”  

Lyra nodded, her gaze steady. “The Council didn’t just take power from the star. They took its will, its voice, and twisted it into a weapon. Every time they siphoned more, they made it darker, colder. They turned it into a tool to keep us in chains.”  

Vaelin stepped forward, his expression unreadable but filled with something that felt like gravity—like the weight of truth pressing down on him as much as on her. “You were never meant to see this,” he said. “But now that you have, you can’t unsee it.”  

Sága’s fingers tightened around the edge of the map. The realization was a slow burn, seeping into her bones like rust. She had spent years running from the truth, from the guilt of keeping the systems alive, from the fear of what she might become if she ever questioned too much. But now, standing here in the silence of this forgotten place, she felt something shift inside her—not just a change in belief, but a change in *purpose*.  

The star’s light flickered again, brighter now, as if it had been waiting for her to make this choice. She looked up at the shifting murals that lined the walls, their images no longer static but alive, whispering stories of a world that had once thrived in harmony with the celestial force above. And she knew, with a clarity that made her stomach twist, that this truth could not be buried again.  

She closed her eyes for a moment, feeling the pulse of the chamber echo in her chest. When she opened them, they were filled with determination. “I can’t let them keep this,” she said, her voice firm now. “Not after what I’ve seen.”  

The sigils around the archive flared, not in warning, but in recognition. The star had been waiting for someone to remember, to fight, to *awaken*. And Sága, once a scavenger lost in the ruins of Eternis, had finally found her place—not as a servant, but as a voice against the silence. And for the first time in years, Sága felt like she was no longer just surviving in the ruins of Eternis—she was *fighting* for something greater.

---

The archive was smaller than the Hidden Chamber, a secluded alcove that seemed to exist apart from the rest of the station. The walls were lined with ancient star maps, their surfaces covered in glowing inscriptions that shifted when touched. Sága ran her fingers over one, and the symbols rearranged themselves into a new pattern—something she didn’t understand but could feel in her bones.

“This is it,” Lyra said, her voice low. “The Council has hidden everything here. Every truth about the star, every record of its sentience. They’ve used this to maintain their control.”

Sága looked at the maps, at the intricate lines and glowing points that seemed to pulse with a life of their own. She had seen similar things before in the data crystal, but now, surrounded by these physical remnants, she felt the weight of history pressing down on her.

“This isn’t just about energy,” she said quietly. “It’s about something deeper. Something *alive*.”

Vaelin nodded. “The star is more than a power source. It’s a consciousness, Sága. A being that has been used for centuries to sustain the Council’s rule. They’ve manipulated its light, twisted its essence into a tool of control.”

Sága’s breath caught in her throat. The idea of the star as a sentient being was something she had never considered before. She had always thought of it as a distant, indifferent force, a resource that could be harnessed for progress. But now, standing here with Lyra and Vaelin, she realized how much of that truth had been stolen from her.

She looked at the maps again, her fingers tracing the glowing lines. “If they’ve used it like this… then what happens if we stop them?”

Lyra’s expression darkened. “Then the star will awaken. And it won’t forgive.”

Sága felt a chill run through her. She had seen the destruction of the world below, the way people had been left to wither in the dark as Eternis drained their planet’s life force. The Council had justified it all with promises of progress, of salvation. But now she saw the cost—how much they had taken, how much they had erased.

She turned to Lyra and Vaelin, her voice steady but filled with doubt. I thought I was helping them. I thought I was doing something good.  

But now, standing here, surrounded by the echoes of a world that had been stolen from its people, I see how much of that belief was just another lie. The Council didn’t bring progress—they built a prison, and I was their silent guard. Every time I kept the systems running, every time I avoided asking questions, I helped them maintain their control over the star, over the planet, over *us*.  

The weight of it presses down on me like a stone, heavier than any I’ve ever carried. I had always believed that technology could bring people together, that Eternis was a beacon of hope. But what if it was just another tool of domination? What if the truth wasn’t a burden, but a weapon—one I now have to wield?  

I trace the glowing inscriptions on the star map, feeling their pulse in my fingertips. The star isn’t just a resource; it’s alive, and it remembers. It *witnesses*. And now, I’m part of that memory, part of the truth they tried so hard to erase.  

If I destroy this, if I let them win, I’ll be no better than the ones who built this lie. But if I carry it forward—if I use it to fight back—then I have to face what that means. I have to face the fact that I’ve been complicit in their crimes, and that I may never be able to reclaim the life I once thought I was protecting.  

The chamber seems to hold its breath, waiting for my answer. And for the first time, I don’t feel like a scavenger anymore. I feel like someone who has seen the truth, and who now must decide whether to let it die or let it live.Vaelin’s gaze was piercing. “You were helping them *maintain* their control. Not create a better future.”

Sága looked down at the star maps, the inscriptions shifting like thoughts in her mind. She had spent years believing that the Council’s actions were necessary, that progress required sacrifice. But now she saw how much of that sacrifice had been forced upon people who had no choice but to accept it.

She felt something shift inside her—a deep, aching realization that she had been complicit in their lies. That she had helped build the prison, even if only by accident. And yet, she also knew that this knowledge could not be buried again. Not now.

“I can’t let them keep this,” she said finally, her voice firm. “Not after what I’ve seen.”

Lyra’s eyes lit up with something like hope. “Then you must act.”

Vaelin stepped closer, his voice low and steady. Vaelin’s voice was low, edged with something that felt like both warning and resolve. “The Council will not let this go quietly. They’ll do anything to keep their lies intact—anything. And if they find out you’ve taken this knowledge, they won’t just silence you. They’ll erase you, Sága. From the records, from the minds of those who remember, from existence itself.”  

He stepped closer, his presence a quiet storm. “You think they built Eternis to save the world? No. They built it to *control* it. To keep the star’s power in their hands, to make sure no one ever questions what they’ve done. If you expose this, if you let the truth slip through their fingers, they’ll stop at nothing to crush it.”  

Sága felt the weight of his words settle over her like a shroud. She had always believed that knowledge was a tool for progress, but now she saw how easily it could be twisted into a weapon of suppression. The Council’s lies weren’t just about history—they were about power, about shaping reality to fit their vision. And if she brought the truth back to the people below, they might not be ready to face it.  

She looked at the shifting star maps again, her fingers hovering over the inscriptions. “What if they’re right?” she whispered. “What if this knowledge is too dangerous? What if revealing it destroys everything?”  

Lyra’s eyes softened, but her voice was firm. “Then you must decide whether you’d rather live in a world built on lies or fight for one that might be worth the risk.”  

Sága swallowed hard, the silence between them thick with unspoken fears. She had spent years believing in the Council’s mission, in their promise of salvation. But now, standing here with the truth burning in her chest, she realized that some truths were too heavy to carry—and others were too vital to leave buried.  

She exhaled slowly, her resolve hardening. “I’ll carry it,” she said, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. “Even if it means losing everything.” They’ll do anything to protect their lies.”

Sága looked at the star maps again, feeling the weight of their truth settle over her. She had spent so long running from the past, afraid of what it might reveal. But now, with the knowledge that the Council had stolen not just energy but *life* itself, she knew there was no more room for fear.

She looked at Lyra and Vaelin, their faces filled with quiet determination. Sága’s fingers trembled as they hovered over the final sigil, its light pulsing like a heartbeat in the silence of the archive. The weight of the moment pressed down on her—not just the physical burden of the chamber’s gravity, but the enormity of what she was about to do. She had spent years running from this truth, from the memories that had been stolen, from the guilt that clung to her like a second skin. And now, standing here, surrounded by the ancient star maps and their shifting inscriptions, she felt that weight shift into something else: resolve.

She looked up at Lyra and Vaelin, their faces etched with quiet certainty. They had seen this before, had walked these corridors of deception without flinching. But she hadn’t. She had believed in the Council’s vision, in the promise of progress, even when it came at the cost of a world that no longer existed. Now, the truth was not just a burden—it was a weapon, and she had to decide how to wield it.

The murals outside flickered again, their shifting colors like a living testament to what had been erased. She could almost see them whispering, pleading, warning her of the consequences. But she knew now that the Council had not just stolen energy from the star—they had stolen *life*, *history*, and *hope*. They had built Eternis as a prison, not a sanctuary, and for years, they had convinced the people above that their suffering was necessary for a brighter future.

She thought of Kael, of the way he had looked at her when she first revealed what she knew. His disappointment had been sharp, like a blade against her ribs. She had been his friend once, someone who believed in the same mission. But now, she saw the truth in his eyes—his fear, his complicity. He had not just followed orders; he had *chosen* to believe in them.

What if she made the same mistake? What if she became another cog in the Council’s machine, another tool of their lies?

The sigils around the archive flared once more, as if acknowledging her hesitation. She could feel the pulse of the star beneath her feet, its energy humming through the walls like a long-forgotten memory. It was not just power—it was *awareness*. A presence that had been twisted and used for centuries, now calling to her with a voice she could not yet understand.

She thought of the people below, their lives drained by the station’s siphoning, their histories rewritten by the Council’s hand. She thought of the lies she had helped spread, the comfort she had given them in exchange for silence. And then, she thought of what it would mean to carry this truth forward—to risk everything, to face the wrath of those who had built their empire on deception.

Her voice was steady now, though her heart still raced. “I can’t let them keep this,” she said, more to herself than to them. “Not after what I’ve seen. Not after what they’ve done.”

Lyra stepped closer, her hand resting gently on Sága’s shoulder. “Then you must act,” she said softly, but with unshakable conviction.

Vaelin’s gaze was steady, his expression unreadable, yet filled with something that felt like relief. “The Council will not let this go quietly,” he warned. “They’ll do anything to protect their lies.”

Sága looked at the star maps again, her fingers tracing the glowing lines that seemed to pulse with a life of their own. She had spent so long fearing what she might become if she uncovered too much, if she challenged too much. But now, as she stood in the heart of the archive, she realized that fear had been the Council’s weapon all along.

She exhaled slowly, feeling the air shift around her as if the chamber itself were holding its breath. “Then I’ll carry it,” she said, her voice firm now. “Even if it means losing everything.”

For a moment, the room was silent. The only sound was the hum of the star’s energy, deep and resonant, like a promise or a warning. She had spent years believing that progress required sacrifice. Now, she saw that the Council had never been about progress at all—they had been about control.

And she would not be complicit in that anymore.

The chamber pulsed once more, as if in agreement with her choice. Sága felt something shift inside her—a deep, aching certainty that this was no longer just about uncovering the past. It was about shaping the future, even if it meant tearing down everything she had ever known. “Even if it means losing everything.”

Lyra smiled faintly. “That’s all we need.”

Vaelin nodded, his expression unreadable but filled with something that felt like relief.

Sága turned back to the star maps, her fingers brushing over the glowing inscriptions once more. The weight of her past was still there, pressing down on her like a stone. But now, she saw it not as a burden, but as a warning. A call to action.

She had spent years believing that the Council’s mission was for the greater good. That their control over Eternis and the star was necessary for progress. But now, with this knowledge, she saw how much of that belief had been built on lies.

And she knew, with a certainty that made her heart race, that she could not return to that way of thinking. Not after what she had seen. Not after what she had learned.

She took a deep breath, the air in the archive feeling heavier than it had in the Hidden Chamber. She looked at Lyra and Vaelin, their expressions filled with quiet hope.

“I’ll do whatever it takes,” she said. “Even if it means risking everything.”

Lyra reached out, placing a hand on Sága’s shoulder. Lyra’s eyes gleamed with something that wasn’t just hope—it was certainty, like she had known this moment would come. “Then you are one of us,” she said, her voice steady, almost reverent. “And the Council will come for you. They’ve always known someone would find this place. They’ve spent centuries ensuring no one could. But now… now they have a problem.”

Vaelin’s hand rested on the console, the sigils flaring in response to Sága’s decision. “They’ll send enforcers. Maybe even Kael.” His tone was quiet, but there was a sharp edge to it, like a blade waiting to be drawn. “You won’t be safe. Not for long.”

Sága swallowed hard, the weight of their words pressing against her ribs. She had spent years running from the truth, afraid of what it might mean for her past, her choices, her very identity. But now, standing in the archive with the star’s secrets etched into its walls, she understood that silence was a form of complicity. That inaction was a betrayal.

She looked at Lyra and Vaelin, their faces lit by the shifting inscriptions, and felt something shift inside herself too—no longer fear, but purpose. “Then I’ll be ready,” she said, her voice firm now. “Even if it means losing everything.”

Lyra’s smile was slow, deliberate, like a promise made in the dark. “That’s all we need.”Sága nodded slowly, the weight of her decision settling over her like a second skin. She had spent years running from the truth, hiding in the shadows of Eternis, afraid of what she might find. But now, with the knowledge that the Council had stolen not just energy but *life*, she knew there was no more room for fear.

She looked at the star maps again, their glowing inscriptions shifting like thoughts in her mind. The truth was here, and it would not be buried again. Not by her. Not by anyone who still believed in something greater than themselves.

And as she stepped forward, the chamber seemed to pulse with life once more, as if acknowledging her choice.

The past had been stolen from her people. But now, Sága would take it back.
