Jules reveals the truth about the Veil Shatterer's role in siphoning magic from the lower districts to the elite through a powerful mural, which he uses to awaken the city's people to their stolen power. He and Elian locate and activate the Mirror of Equilibrium beneath the cathedral, breaking the curse and redistributing magic, transforming Jules from an artist into a revolutionary. The city begins to shift as the system collapses, exposing the lies and offering a new reality where magic is shared rather than hoarded.
