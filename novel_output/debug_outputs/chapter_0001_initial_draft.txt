Sága moved through the corridors of Eternis with a quiet urgency, her boots crunching against the brittle floor panels that had once been pristine but now lay in splinters and dust. The station was no longer what it had been. She could feel it in the way the air tasted stale and metallic, the way gravity tugged at her limbs like a child’s hand trying to pull her down. It wasn’t just broken—it was decaying, unraveling with every passing day, as though time itself had given up on it.

She adjusted the straps of her pack, which clung to her shoulders like a second skin. Inside, she carried tools scavenged from the ruins: a rusted wrench, a cracked scanner, and a journal—its pages filled with sketches and notes from her past life as an engineer. That life had been one of purpose and precision, but now it felt like a ghost haunting her steps.

The station’s lights flickered erratically, casting long shadows that stretched across the walls like claws. Sága had once worked in these very corridors, ensuring that the intricate systems kept Eternis aloft, humming with power. But now, every system seemed to be on the verge of collapse. The gravity fields were unstable, and she had learned to move carefully—like a dancer avoiding sharp edges.

She paused near a bulkhead that had long since been sealed. A faint hum echoed from beyond it, something mechanical and old, like the heartbeat of a dying thing. She traced her fingers along the metal, feeling its warmth despite the cold air around her. It was strange, how the station still held onto some semblance of life even as everything else crumbled.

She had been here before—many times. But now, she felt different. Not just because she had become a scavenger, but because she no longer trusted the stories they told about Eternis. The Council’s narrative of progress and salvation had always been a fragile thing, like glass in a storm. And Sága had helped shatter it.

The weight of that truth pressed on her chest. She had once believed in the grand design, in the idea that Eternis was a beacon of hope for the planet below. That the star’s energy was a gift, a miracle granted to those who sought it. But now, every time she looked up at the distant glow of the star, she felt its pull as something unnatural, like a hand reaching down from the void to drag her into its depths.

She moved on, past towering columns that had once held great halls but were now collapsed or broken. The dust was thick here, swirling in the dim light of failing energy cells. She coughed, feeling the sharp sting of it in her throat. This place was a tomb, and she was walking through its corridors like a ghost.

As she passed a maintenance hatch, something caught her eye. It wasn’t part of the usual layout—too small, too close to the floor. The metal was dulled by time, but not completely rusted. She crouched down, brushing away the dust with careful fingers, and found a seam in the panel that hadn’t been there before.

Her pulse quickened. This wasn’t just a random hatch—it was hidden. And that meant something. Maybe it had been sealed for a reason. Or maybe it had been forgotten.

She pressed her hand against the panel, feeling the faintest vibration beneath her fingertips. A soft click echoed through the chamber, and then the panel slid open with a hiss of air and creak of metal. Inside was a narrow passage, barely wide enough to fit through. She hesitated for only a moment before stepping in.

The air was colder here, almost like it had been sealed away from the rest of the station. The walls were lined with old wiring and faded labels, some still legible, others just smudges of ink and time. She moved forward, her flashlight cutting through the darkness. It wasn’t long before she reached a small chamber, its ceiling low and its floor uneven.

In the center was a control console, half-buried in dust and decay. The interface was flickering, like a dying star itself. But as she brushed away more of the grime, she saw something that made her breath catch—holographic projections, fragments of data still active despite the station’s collapse.

She reached out, hesitating for only a second before activating the console. A soft hum filled the air, and then a single line of text appeared in the center of the chamber:

**“The star is not a gift, but a burden.”**

Her fingers trembled as she read on. The logs were old, but they still held weight. They spoke of Eternis being built not to harness the star’s energy for progress, but to siphon it away—away from the planet below. The Council had promised that this energy would bring prosperity, that it would be a miracle for all. But in reality, it was an act of theft.

She read more, her mind racing. The star’s light was borrowed, its life stolen. And with every pulse of energy siphoned, the world beneath Eternis was slowly unraveling. It wasn’t just a failing structure—it was a wound on the planet itself.

A cold realization settled over her. She had helped build this lie. She had once been one of the engineers who maintained the systems that kept the star’s energy flowing, unaware of the cost. Now, standing in this hidden chamber, she felt like a traitor to everything she had once believed in.

She reached for the scanner in her pack and began recording what she found. Each line of text was a shard of truth, a piece of history that had been buried beneath layers of deception. She wasn’t sure where this information would lead, but it was clear now—this station was not a miracle. It was a prison.

As she worked, the console flickered again, and another log appeared. This one was more personal. A voice, dry and worn with age, spoke through the projection:

**“They told us the star would bring salvation. But I’ve seen what it does. Every time we draw power from it, something gives in return. The planet is dying beneath us, and they don’t care.”**

Sága’s hands clenched into fists. She had known something was wrong, but this—this made it undeniable. The Council wasn’t just lying about the star’s energy; they were using it as a weapon, manipulating history to justify their actions.

She moved deeper into the chamber, her flashlight catching on something in the corner. A small door, sealed with old locks and rusted hinges. She had no idea what was behind it, but the feeling that she was being watched made her heart race.

She pressed her ear against the metal, listening for any sound beyond the hum of the console. Nothing. Just silence.

With a deep breath, she pushed the door open. Inside was another chamber, smaller than the last but just as heavy with history. The walls were lined with data tablets, some still glowing faintly, others cracked and dark. In the center stood a single pedestal, its surface worn and uneven.

On it lay a small device—a personal log recorder, its screen flickering with static. She reached for it, her fingers brushing against the cold metal. As she activated it, the screen stabilized, and a voice filled the room, steady and clear despite the years of neglect.

**“This is Engineer Veyra. I was part of the original team that installed the star’s conduits. We were told we were saving the world, but I know the truth now. The Council has been lying to us all along. The energy they draw from the star is not a gift—it’s a curse. And every time we use it, we leave behind something worse.”**

Sága’s breath caught in her throat. She had never heard of Veyra before, but the words felt like they had been carved into her soul.

She continued to listen as the log played on, describing how the planet below was slowly being consumed by the energy siphoned from the star. How the Council had erased all records of this truth, rewriting history so that Eternis would be seen as a miracle rather than a catastrophe.

**“I tried to warn them. I tried to stop it. But they wouldn’t listen. They said we were building the future, and if we did our job, we’d be remembered as heroes.”**

The words echoed in Sága’s mind, and for the first time since she had left her position on the Council’s team, she felt something stir within her—not guilt, but anger.

She closed the log and stepped back. The chamber was silent now, but the weight of what she had just learned pressed down on her like a mountain.

As she turned to leave, a sound behind her made her freeze. A low, guttural whisper—just loud enough to be heard in the stillness.

“Sága,” it said.

She spun around, flashlight beam cutting through the darkness. Three figures stood at the threshold of the chamber, their faces obscured by masks and hoods. They were scavengers like her, but they carried themselves with a different kind of authority—like they knew something she didn’t.

“Who are you?” she asked, voice steady despite the fear curling in her gut.

The leader stepped forward, his face still hidden. “We know what you’re looking for.”

Sága’s heart pounded. She had expected to be alone in this discovery, but now it seemed like others had been watching her all along. “And what do you want with me?”

He tilted his head slightly, as if considering the question. “You’ve seen things that shouldn’t have been seen. You’re not the first. But you might be the last.”

She didn’t understand, but she wasn’t about to ask questions now. Her fingers curled around the scanner in her pack.

“I need answers,” she said, her voice quiet but firm.

The leader nodded, his expression unreadable. “Then you’ll need more than just this chamber. There are others like it—places where the truth has been buried. And we’ve been waiting for someone to find them.”

Sága’s mind raced. She had always thought of Eternis as a place of decay, but now she saw it differently. It wasn’t just a structure—it was a machine, and she had been one of its cogs.

She took a step back, her flashlight trembling slightly in her hand. “Why are you telling me this?”

The leader’s voice was low, almost like a whisper. “Because the Council is not as powerful as they claim to be. They fear what you’ve found, and they fear what others might find if they follow your path.”

She looked at him, searching for any sign of deception. But there was none. Just a quiet determination in his eyes.

“What do you want from me?” she asked again.

He stepped closer, his presence looming like a shadow. “We want you to stop looking. We want you to leave this place and forget what you’ve seen.”

Sága’s breath caught in her throat. The words struck her like a hammer. She had come here seeking truth, but now it seemed that others wanted to bury it.

“I can’t do that,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “Not after everything I’ve learned.”

The leader studied her for a moment, then exhaled slowly. “Then you’re not just a scavenger anymore. You’re something more.”

She didn’t know what that meant, but the weight of his words made her feel like she had crossed a threshold.

“I’ll keep going,” she said finally. “If I leave this here, someone else will find it. Maybe they’ll do something about it.”

The leader nodded again, and then he turned away, motioning for his companions to follow. “Then you’re not just another ghost in the ruins. You’re a threat to them.”

As they disappeared into the darkness, Sága stood alone once more, but this time, she felt something shift inside her. She was no longer just a scavenger searching for scraps. She was a woman who had uncovered a truth that could change everything.

She turned back to the console and began documenting what she had found, not just for herself, but for anyone who might one day find this place and realize the cost of their progress.

The star’s light above her still burned, but now it felt like a warning rather than a promise. And Sága, for the first time in years, felt like she was ready to fight—not just to survive, but to change the story.
