Sága stood in the archive sector, her breath shallow, her fingers tracing the edge of Dain’s workstation. The silence here was unnatural—too still, as if the air itself had been held in suspense. The terminal screen flickered once, then died, leaving only the dim glow of the overhead lights to cast long shadows across the rows of terminals. She had never seen this place so empty. Dain’s station was a mess, the console drawers flung open, data chips scattered like discarded bones. A single memory card lay half-buried beneath a pile of papers, its casing cracked and smudged with what looked like dried blood.

“He was always careful... why would he leave without a trace?” she murmured, her voice barely more than a whisper. She crouched down, picking up the card and brushing away the dust. Her fingers trembled slightly as she inserted it into the nearby terminal. The screen flickered to life, displaying a file labeled *Erebus*. A chill ran through her.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she inserted it into the nearby terminal. The screen flickered to life, displaying a file labeled *Erebus*. A chill ran through her. This was the same file she had encountered in the memory vaults—hidden, forbidden, and dangerous. But this time, it wasn’t just a fragment. It was whole. And it was waiting for her.“The system doesn’t let people just disappear,” she said aloud, more to herself than to anyone else. She had seen it happen before—people vanishing without a trace, their names erased from records, their histories rewritten. But Dain? He had been too careful, too methodical. He would never have left without a fight.

She pulled up the last accessed files on the system, searching for any indication of what had happened. The logs were clean—too clean. No sign of forced access, no error messages, no signs of tampering. It was as if Dain had simply... vanished. She ran a diagnostic scan, but the results were inconclusive. Whatever had happened to him, it had been done with precision.

“I need to find out what he knew,” she whispered, her voice thick with determination. The weight of the memory card in her hand felt heavier now, as if it held the key to something far greater than she had imagined.

She left the archive sector quickly, her steps echoing in the narrow corridors. The city around her felt more oppressive than ever, the flickering lights casting jagged shadows that seemed to stretch toward her. She knew she couldn’t stay here. If Dain had been taken, it meant he had uncovered something dangerous—something the system wanted buried.

If Dain had been taken, it meant he had uncovered something dangerous—something the system wanted buried.

Her next stop was Dain’s apartment, a forgotten relic nestled in the city’s skeletal remains where once there were homes now reduced to hollow shells. The air here was thick with the scent of rust and decay, the ground paved with glass-like stones that cracked underfoot, echoing like broken bones. This place wasn’t just desolate—it was a graveyard of memory, a place where the past had been erased not just from records, but from the very earth itself. She climbed the rickety stairs, her boots scraping against the worn metal as she made her way to what remained of Dain’s refuge. The building had once been a place of refuge for those who had fallen through the cracks of society, but now it was nothing more than a relic of the past. She climbed the rusted stairs, her boots scraping against the worn metal as she made her way to the top floor.

The door was slightly ajar, as if someone had left in a hurry. She pushed it open carefully, stepping into the dimly lit apartment. The air inside was thick with dust and the faint scent of old paper. A single lamp flickered on the wall, casting long shadows across the room. The furniture was sparse—just a few chairs, a small table, and a cot that looked like it hadn’t been used in years.

She moved through the space, her eyes scanning for anything out of place. It wasn’t until she reached the bookshelf that she found it—a hidden compartment behind a row of old tomes. She pulled one down, revealing a small drawer filled with notes and documents. She opened the top one, her heart pounding as she read the words scrawled in Dain’s handwriting.

“This isn’t just a warning—it’s a map.” Her voice was barely audible, but the weight of the words hit her like a physical blow. The notes were filled with coordinates, references to locations deep within the city’s underbelly. There were mentions of the lower levels, the forgotten sectors, and something called *The Spire*. She had heard that name before, though she couldn’t recall where.

“If he was asking questions, he might have found something dangerous.” She closed her eyes for a moment, her breath unsteady. Dain had been careful, but even he had been caught in the system’s web. The thought sent a shiver down her spine. What if she followed the same path? What if the very thing she was trying to uncover was what would destroy her?

But she couldn’t stop now. Not after everything she had seen, not after everything she had lost. “I can’t turn back now,” she whispered, more to herself than to anyone else. She gathered the notes and tucked them into her coat, her hands shaking slightly.

She left the apartment quickly, her mind racing. The map Dain had left behind was a lead, but it was also a warning. If he had been taken for asking the wrong questions, what would happen if she did the same? The thought lingered in her mind as she made her way through the city’s lower levels, navigating the narrow alleys and forgotten streets.

The underground market was a place few dared to venture, hidden beneath layers of concrete and steel. It was a place of secrets, where memory traders dealt in stolen recollections and forbidden knowledge. The air was thick with the scent of ozone and something more pungent—something like fear. Sága moved through the crowd carefully, her eyes scanning for the trader she had heard about from whispers in the dark.

She found him in a dimly lit corner, his face obscured by a hood that cast deep shadows over his features. He was old, his hands gnarled with age, but his eyes were sharp—too sharp. “You’re not the first to ask about Dain,” he said without looking up from the stack of memory chips on the table in front of him. His voice was low, almost a whisper.

“I need answers,” Sága replied, her voice steady despite the fear that coiled in her chest. “He was my colleague. He left something behind.”

The trader finally looked up, his gaze piercing. “The system doesn’t like people who remember too much.” He leaned forward slightly, his voice dropping to a near whisper. “You think you’re the first to come looking for him? You think you’re the only one who’s asking questions?”

Sága felt a chill run through her. “What do you mean?”

He tapped the edge of the table with a single finger. “There are others. People who have seen what the system does to those who dig too deep. They vanish, just like Dain. But some of them... they survive. They remember.”

She swallowed hard. “If you want answers, you’ll have to go deeper than you think.”

The trader’s lips curled into a faint smile. “You’re not ready for that.” He reached into his coat and pulled out a small device—a memory chip, its surface etched with symbols she didn’t recognize. “This is a key. It will lead you to the ones who know what happened to Dain. But be warned—once you follow this path, there’s no turning back.”

Sága took the chip, her fingers trembling slightly as she held it. “What happens if I don’t take it?”

The trader’s smile faded. “Then you’ll never know the truth.” He turned away, disappearing into the shadows as quickly as he had appeared.

She left the market feeling more alone than ever. The weight of the memory chip in her hand was a reminder that she was no longer just an observer. She was part of something bigger now, something dangerous. And the closer she got to the truth, the more she realized how little she truly understood.

Her next stop was the maintenance corridor near the memory vaults, a place she had only ever seen in passing. The air here was colder, the walls lined with rusting pipes and flickering lights that cast long, jagged shadows on the floor. She moved carefully, her footsteps muffled by the thick layer of dust that coated everything.

She found the former enforcer near the entrance to a sealed-off section of the corridor. He was older than she had expected, his face lined with years of wear and fear. His eyes were dark, filled with something that looked like regret. “You shouldn’t be here,” he said without looking up.

“I need to know what happened to Dain,” she replied, her voice steady despite the fear that threatened to overtake her.

The enforcer finally looked at her, his expression unreadable. “He asked too many questions about the archives.” He hesitated for a moment, then added, “They don’t just erase memories—they erase people.”

Sága’s breath caught in her throat. “Who are *they*?”

He didn’t answer immediately, his gaze flickering to the shadows around them as if someone might be listening. “If you keep digging, they’ll come for you next.” His voice was low, almost a whisper.

She stepped closer, her heart pounding. “What did Dain find?”

The enforcer’s eyes darkened. “Something that shouldn’t have been found.” He looked away, his expression pained. “He knew too much. And now he’s gone.”

Sága felt a surge of anger and fear rise within her. “I can’t just walk away from this. Not after everything I’ve seen.”

The enforcer studied her for a long moment, then nodded slowly. “Then you’d better be ready to face what’s waiting for you.” He turned and disappeared into the shadows, leaving her alone in the cold, silent corridor.

She left the maintenance area quickly, her mind racing. The enforcer’s words haunted her—*they erase people*. She had seen it happen before, but she had never truly understood the depth of it. Dain hadn’t just vanished; he had been *erased*, his existence wiped from the city’s records, his name lost to the void.

She followed the lead from the map, navigating the forgotten sectors of the city until she reached an abandoned building that had long since been sealed off. The air was thick with the scent of decay, and the walls were covered in graffiti that seemed to whisper warnings she couldn’t quite hear. She pushed through the rusted door, her heart pounding as she stepped into the darkness.

The chamber beyond was unlike anything she had ever seen. It was a vast, hollow space filled with strange machines and intricate devices that pulsed with a faint, eerie light. The walls were lined with memory storage units, each one glowing faintly as if they were alive. She moved cautiously, her footsteps echoing in the silence.

In the center of the chamber, she found what she was looking for—a large, circular platform surrounded by data terminals and control panels. The air around it felt heavier, as if the very fabric of reality had been altered here. She approached carefully, her eyes scanning the displays that flickered with unreadable symbols.

“This isn’t just about control... it’s about power.” Her voice was barely a whisper, but the weight of the words settled in her chest like a stone. The system wasn’t just erasing memories; it was *stealing them*, using them to fuel something far greater than she had imagined.

She moved closer, her fingers brushing against the edge of one of the terminals. A sudden surge of energy coursed through her, and for a moment, she saw something—fragments of memories that weren’t her own. Faces, voices, moments frozen in time, all of them lost to the system’s grasp. She pulled back quickly, her breath unsteady.

“They’re not just erasing memories—they’re stealing them.” The realization hit her like a physical blow. This wasn’t just about control; it was about *power*, and the people who had been taken were no longer just victims. They were *resources*, their minds used to fuel something even more terrifying than she had imagined.

She took a step back, her mind racing. If this was true, then Dain hadn’t just disappeared—he had been *taken* for what he knew. And if the system was willing to go this far to protect its secrets, then she was in far more danger than she had ever realized.

“I have to keep going. For Dain. For everyone.” She whispered the words to herself, a quiet vow that echoed through the empty chamber. The truth was out there, and she would find it—even if it cost her everything.
