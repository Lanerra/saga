The team discovers that *Echoâ€™s Wake* is an ancient construct tied to the Lunar Loop Colony Eternity, which is designed to preserve and test time rather than trap it. They confront the reality that they are not just visitors but participants in a trial meant to judge their resolve. Kaelen realizes he is the key to breaking the Loop, and the team decides to face the past instead of fleeing from it, embracing the possibility of rewriting their fate.
