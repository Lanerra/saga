Sága’s breath was shallow as she stepped into the Archive. The air was thick with dust and a strange, electric scent that clung to her skin like a second layer. She had heard whispers of this place—how it was hidden deep within Eternis, beyond the reach of the Council's patrols, where only those who truly sought the truth could find their way. But now, standing in its dim light, she felt as though she had entered a tomb. The walls were lined with towering shelves, each one crammed with tomes and data tablets that glowed faintly, as if they still held some sliver of the star’s consciousness within them. Shadows stretched long across the floor, and every step echoed in the silence like a warning.

Lyra was already there, her hands gripping the edge of an ancient console, her eyes scanning the shifting inscriptions on its surface. She had found something—something that would change everything. Sága hesitated at the threshold, her heart pounding in her chest. The Archive wasn’t just a place; it was a relic of the past, a prison for knowledge that the Council had deemed too dangerous to share. And yet, here she was, standing in its heart with Lyra, who had risked everything to bring her here.

“I thought you’d never come,” Lyra said without looking up. Her voice was low, almost reverent. “I found something.”

Sága stepped forward, her boots crunching over the brittle dust on the floor. She could feel the weight of what she was about to see pressing down on her like a storm. “What is it?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Lyra turned, her expression unreadable. “Proof that your mentor wasn’t just another Council loyalist.”

Sága’s stomach twisted. The name had been spoken so often in the past weeks—whispered by scavengers, muttered by Kael, and now here, echoing through the Archive like a curse. She had spent so long believing that he was one of them, that his work had been part of the Council’s grand design to bring progress. But Lyra’s words cut through that illusion like a blade.

She followed Lyra deeper into the chamber, past rows of books whose spines were cracked and faded, their pages curling in on themselves like the remains of something once alive. The walls pulsed with faint blue light, as if the Archive itself was breathing. Sága’s fingers brushed against one of the data tablets, and the inscriptions shifted, rearranging themselves into a message that had not been there before.

Lyra reached out and touched it. “This is his work,” she said. “He wasn’t just an engineer. He was trying to stop them.”

Sága stared at the tablet, her mind racing. She had always believed that the Council’s narrative of progress was the only truth worth knowing. That Eternis was a beacon of hope, a place where people could rise above their pasts and build something better. But now, with Lyra’s hand on the console, she felt the weight of that belief slipping away.

She turned to Lyra, her voice raw with disbelief. “That’s impossible. The Council would have killed him if he tried to resist.”

Lyra didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she pulled a crystalline disk from a shelf and placed it on the console. It hummed softly, like a heartbeat. “He didn’t resist,” she said at last. “He tried to save us. But they found out. They silenced him before he could act.”

Sága’s fingers trembled as she reached for the disk. She had spent years scavenging through Eternis, sifting through its ruins for scraps of information, always believing that the truth was buried beneath layers of lies and propaganda. But now, this—this was something else. This was a confession. A record of what the Council had done in secret.

She looked up at Lyra, her eyes wide with something between fear and awe. “Why did you bring me here?”

Lyra met her gaze, steady and unyielding. “Because you’re the only one who can carry this forward.”

Sága’s chest tightened. She had always been a scavenger, someone who took what she could and moved on. But now, standing in the Archive with Lyra, she felt the pull of something deeper. The weight of her mentor’s work, the cost of his silence, the knowledge that the Council had spent centuries rewriting history to maintain their control.

She reached for the disk again, but this time, she hesitated. “What if I’m not ready?”

Lyra shook her head. “You’re already ready. You just don’t know it yet.”

Sága swallowed hard. She had no choice now. The truth was too close, and the Council’s lies were too heavy to ignore.

The data panels in the Archive’s central chamber flickered with a life of their own, as if they remembered the hands that had once touched them. Lyra moved through the room with practiced ease, her fingers tracing patterns on the ancient glass, pulling up holographic projections of events that had been erased from history. Sága watched in silence, her heart pounding as she saw images of Eternis not as a sanctuary, but as a prison.

She had seen enough to know that the Council’s narrative was a lie. That they had built Eternis not to save the planet below, but to control it. To siphon its life force through the star and bind it to their will. And now, she saw her mentor in those projections—his face lined with exhaustion, his hands stained with dust and oil as he worked tirelessly to uncover the Council’s secrets.

“He tried to save us,” Sága whispered, her voice barely audible over the hum of the panels. “But they stopped him.”

Lyra nodded, her eyes fixed on the screen. “He left this for us. A final message, a warning.”

Sága stepped closer, her breath catching as she read the words that had been etched into the crystal’s surface. They were written in a language she barely recognized, but the meaning was clear.

_"The Council has built their empire on lies. The star is not a power source—it is a living being, bound to this station by chains of light and shadow. If you seek the truth, do not look for it in the stars above. Look within yourself. The choice is yours, but know this: once you take this path, there is no turning back."_

Sága’s hands clenched into fists. She had always believed that knowledge was a weapon, that understanding the past could shape the future. But now she saw the cost of that knowledge—the silence, the erasure, the lives lost in the name of progress.

She turned to Lyra, her voice shaking with emotion. “He knew. He knew everything.”

Lyra’s expression was grim. “And he tried to stop them. But they didn’t let him finish his work.”

Sága felt a surge of anger rise within her, sharp and bitter. She had spent so long living under the Council’s rule, believing in their promises of betterment and prosperity. Now, that belief was shattered. And yet, she couldn’t deny the truth in Lyra’s words.

She looked down at the data tablet once more, its inscriptions shifting as if responding to her presence. “What do we do now?”

Lyra hesitated. “We take this to the Reclaimers.”

Sága frowned. “You think they’ll believe me? I’ve spent so long being a scavenger, not a rebel.”

Lyra smiled faintly. “That’s exactly why you’re here. You have the last piece of the puzzle. The Council will never let this go quietly. They’ll do anything to keep their lies intact.”

Sága felt a cold weight settle in her chest. She had no illusions about what was coming next. The Council wouldn’t just let them walk away with this knowledge. They would come for them, and they would come hard.

But she couldn’t stop now. Not after everything she had seen. Not after the truth had been laid bare before her.

She took a deep breath, steadying herself. “Then I’ll do what I can.”

Lyra nodded, her eyes shining with something that looked like hope. “That’s all we need.”

The corridor was narrow and cold, its walls lined with rusted machinery and flickering lights that cast long shadows across the floor. Sága moved carefully, her boots echoing in the silence as they passed through the ruins of Eternis. She had spent years navigating these halls, scavenging for scraps of forgotten knowledge, but tonight felt different.

The Council’s enforcers were out. She could feel their presence in the air, a low hum that vibrated through the metal beneath her feet. Kael had warned her about this—about how the Council would not let them take what they had found. And now, as she and Lyra pressed deeper into the station, she knew they weren’t alone.

She reached out to Lyra, her voice barely above a whisper. “We need to be careful.”

Lyra nodded, her hand gripping Sága’s shoulder. “I know. But we have no choice. The Hidden Chamber is the only place where the truth can be preserved. If we don’t get there before they do, everything will be lost.”

Sága swallowed hard. “What if they find us?”

Lyra’s eyes met hers, steady and unyielding. “Then we’ll face them. But I think you already know that.”

They moved quickly, their footsteps muffled by the thick dust that had settled over the station like a shroud. The air was heavy with the scent of ozone and decay, and every shadow seemed to stretch toward them, as if watching.

As they neared the Hidden Chamber, Sága felt a strange pull in her chest, like something ancient was awakening within her. She had always believed that the star was just a source of power, but now she saw it differently. It wasn’t just energy—it was life, memory, and something far greater than either of them could comprehend.

She reached for the key Lyra had given her, a small crystalline shard that pulsed with light. “This is all he left us,” she said, her voice tinged with sorrow. “He must have known they’d find this. He left it for us to finish what he started.”

Lyra’s grip on Sága’s shoulder tightened. “He didn’t just leave it. He gave it to you. That means something.”

Sága looked at the key in her hand, its surface warm against her palm. It felt like a fragment of something larger, something that had been waiting for her all along.

They reached the entrance to the Hidden Chamber, a massive door etched with symbols that pulsed faintly in the dim light. Lyra stepped forward, placing the key into a slot on the door’s surface. The moment it clicked in, the door groaned open, revealing a vast, circular chamber bathed in blue light.

Inside, the air was thick with tension. Sága could feel the weight of history pressing down on her, the echoes of countless lives lost to the Council’s lies. She stepped inside, her breath catching as she saw what lay before them—ancient data crystals and storage units that seemed to hum with a life of their own.

Lyra moved toward one of the units, her fingers brushing against its surface. “This is it,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “Everything we need.”

Sága followed her, her eyes scanning the chamber for any sign of danger. She had expected to find guards or traps, but instead, she found something far more unsettling—images of the past, of Eternis as it once was, before the Council had taken control.

She saw cities rising from the dust, people living in harmony with the star rather than enslaving it. She saw her mentor standing among them, not as a tool of the Council, but as a voice of truth. And she saw the moment he had been silenced, his work erased, his name forgotten.

Her chest tightened. This was more than just evidence—it was a reckoning.

She turned to Lyra, her voice trembling. “He didn’t just want us to expose them. He wanted us to understand what they did.”

Lyra nodded slowly. “And now we do.”

Sága looked at the data crystal in her hand, its light pulsing like a heartbeat. She had spent so long believing that the Council’s narrative was the only truth worth knowing, but now she saw it for what it was—a lie, a weapon, and a prison.

She took a deep breath, steadying herself. “Then I’ll carry this forward.”

Lyra smiled faintly. “That’s all we need.”

As they moved deeper into the chamber, Sága felt something shift within her. The weight of her past—the guilt, the fear, the uncertainty—was still there, but now it was tempered by something else: purpose.

She had spent so long running from the truth, hiding in the shadows of Eternis, scavenging for scraps of knowledge that didn’t belong to her. But now, she was part of something greater. She was no longer just a scavenger; she was a revolutionary.

And the Council would not let her go quietly.

---

The chamber’s silence was broken by the sound of footsteps—measured, deliberate. Sága and Lyra froze, their eyes darting toward the entrance as figures emerged from the shadows. Council enforcers, clad in dark armor that gleamed with a cold light, stepped into the room with weapons drawn.

Kael stood among them, his expression unreadable as he locked eyes with Sága. He had always been a presence in her life, a man who had once been her friend and now her enemy.

“Sága,” he said, his voice calm but edged with something deeper—something like regret. “You’ve come far.”

Sága’s grip tightened around the data crystal. “I’ve seen the truth, Kael. And I won’t let it be buried again.”

Kael exhaled slowly, as if weighing his next words carefully. “Then you don’t understand what you’re getting into.”

Lyra stepped forward, her voice firm. “We understand more than you do.”

Kael’s eyes flicked to Lyra, then back to Sága. “You were never meant to find this.”

Sága felt a surge of anger rise within her, but she forced herself to remain calm. “Then why did my mentor leave it for me?”

Kael hesitated, and for a moment, Sága saw something in his expression—something that made her heart sink. He wasn’t just an enforcer; he had once been part of the resistance.

“I thought I could change things,” Kael said finally. “But the Council is too powerful. They’ve rewritten history so many times, they control everything. Even the stars.”

Sága’s jaw clenched. “Then you should have joined us instead of working for them.”

Kael’s lips pressed into a thin line. “I tried. But I failed.”

Lyra stepped closer, her voice low and steady. “You didn’t fail. You were just too late.”

Kael looked at Sága, his gaze piercing. “And now you’re standing where I stood. Will you be the one to break their hold, or will you become another failure?”

Sága’s heart pounded in her chest. She had no answer for him—not yet. But she knew that whatever choice she made, it would define who she was.

She looked down at the data crystal, its light pulsing against her palm like a promise. “I’ve already made my choice.”

Kael studied her for a long moment, then nodded slowly. “Then I’ll have to stop you.”

The enforcers moved in, their weapons gleaming in the dim light of the chamber. Sága and Lyra stood their ground, the weight of the truth pressing down on them like a storm.

But Sága knew that this was only the beginning. The Council would not let her walk away with this knowledge. They would kill her if they had to.

And she was ready.

She stepped forward, her voice steady and filled with resolve. “Then let’s see what you’re willing to do.”
