Sága’s boots echoed against the stone as she and Lyra slipped through the narrow passageway, their breath shallow in the cold air that seeped from the cracks in the walls. The dim glow of Eternis's internal lighting flickered overhead, casting long shadows across the dust-laden floor. They had spent weeks navigating the labyrinthine corridors of the station, avoiding patrols and Council enforcers, until they finally reached what Lyra called "the last door." It was a rusted panel embedded in the wall, barely distinguishable from the surrounding metal unless one knew where to look.

Lyra ran her fingers over the surface, pressing against the faint etchings that had been obscured by time and neglect. “This is it,” she murmured, her voice barely audible over the hum of distant machinery. She pressed harder, and with a soft click, the panel slid open, revealing a narrow stairwell spiraling downward into darkness.

Sága hesitated, glancing at Lyra’s determined face. “You sure about this?” she asked, though she already knew the answer.

Lyra nodded. “I’ve seen the blueprints. This is where the old systems are stored—before they were sealed away. If there's anything left of the truth, it’s down here.”

They descended in silence, each step stirring up motes of dust that danced in the dim light like tiny ghosts. The air grew colder, and the hum of the station became more pronounced, almost like a heartbeat. When they reached the bottom, they found themselves in a vast circular chamber, its walls carved from ancient stone that had long since lost its color. A faint blue glow emanated from the center, where a crystalline core pulsed with a rhythm that felt almost organic.

Sága stepped forward, her eyes drawn to the core. It was unlike anything she had seen before—a massive, translucent structure that seemed to shimmer with inner light. The murals surrounding it were etched into the stone, depicting a celestial being with wings of starlight and eyes like twin suns. Its hands reached out toward a glowing orb, which pulsed in time with the core.

“Is this… what I think it is?” Sága whispered, her voice barely audible.

Lyra’s expression was unreadable as she traced one of the murals with her fingers. “It’s not just energy,” she said. “It’s a memory. A record of something ancient—something alive.”

Sága felt a chill crawl up her spine. She had always believed the star was a tool, a source of power that the Council used to maintain control. But now, standing in this chamber, surrounded by the echoes of a forgotten past, she wondered if it had ever been anything else.

The core’s light intensified as they approached, and Sága could feel its presence pressing against her mind, like a whisper from the void. She reached out, hesitating only for a moment before placing her palm against its surface. The moment she did, the chamber shifted. The walls seemed to ripple, and the murals moved as if alive.

She saw visions—images of Eternis not as it was now, but as it once was. A city of light and harmony, where people lived in balance with the star rather than in fear of it. The celestial being hovered above them, its form ethereal yet tangible, guiding them with a wisdom that transcended time. It had not been a weapon, nor a prison. It had been a guardian.

Sága gasped as the vision faded, her heart pounding in her chest. “It wasn’t built to destroy,” she said, her voice trembling. “It was built to protect.”

Lyra stepped back, eyes wide. “They’ve lied about everything,” she said, shaking her head. “This place was never a prison—it was a sanctuary.”

The chamber seemed to pulse in response to their words, the light from the core growing brighter. Sága felt something inside her shift, like the weight of years had finally lifted. She had spent so long believing in the Council’s version of history, but now she saw the truth for what it was: a carefully constructed lie designed to keep power in the hands of the few.

As they stood there, surrounded by ancient knowledge and a star that had been silenced for too long, Sága felt the first stirrings of resolve. She had always thought of herself as a scavenger, someone who picked through the ruins of the past to survive. But now, she realized she was more than that. She was part of something bigger—a truth that could not be buried.

She turned to Lyra, her voice steady despite the storm raging within her. “We have to take this with us. This is what we’ve been searching for.”

Lyra nodded slowly. “Then we need to be careful. The Council won’t let this go quietly.”

As they began to collect data from the chamber, Sága felt the weight of history pressing down on her. She had uncovered more than just records—she had touched something real, something that could change everything.

The corridor was dim, its flickering holograms casting shifting patterns across the walls. Sága’s footsteps were heavy with purpose as she walked toward the end of the tunnel, where a figure waited in the shadows.

Kael stood there, his posture rigid, his eyes sharp with calculation. He had not been easy to find, but he knew she would come.

“You found it,” he said, his voice low and measured.

Sága stopped, her hand still gripping the data crystal she had taken from the chamber. “You knew about this place?”

Kael stepped forward, his gaze never leaving hers. “I knew enough to know that you were getting close. The Council has been hiding this for centuries. They didn’t just build Eternis to siphon power—they built it to trap the star’s consciousness.”

Sága’s breath caught in her throat. “You’re saying the star is alive?”

Kael nodded. “It is. And they’ve been using its energy to maintain control, not for progress. They feared what it would reveal if left free. That’s why they sealed it away, twisted its purpose, and made everyone believe it was a weapon.”

Sága clenched her fists. “So all this time, the Council has been lying to us. To the people below. To the planet itself.”

Kael’s expression darkened. “And you’ve been helping them.”

The words hit like a blow. Sága looked away, her mind racing. She had always believed in the Council’s vision of progress, even when she questioned it. She had followed their rules, accepted their truths, and buried her doubts beneath layers of guilt and survival.

But now, with this knowledge, she felt something shift inside her. Not just anger or fear, but a clarity that had eluded her for so long.

“I didn’t know,” she said quietly. “I thought I was protecting them.”

Kael’s lips curled into a bitter smile. “You were protecting yourself. But the truth is, you’ve been complicit in their lies.”

Sága turned back to him, her eyes burning with defiance. “Then what are we going to do about it?”

Kael studied her for a moment, then exhaled sharply. “The Council will not let this go quietly. They’ve spent centuries ensuring that no one questions the star’s nature. If you take this knowledge back to the Reclaimers, they’ll use it to fight. But be warned—this is not just about power anymore. It’s about truth, and the cost of exposing it.”

Sága’s mind was a storm of emotions. She had always believed that history could be changed, that the past could be rewritten for the sake of the future. But now she saw the flaw in that belief—the Council had not just manipulated events, they had erased them entirely. And if she exposed their lies, would she be any different from them?

She met Kael’s gaze and felt a flicker of something between them—a connection forged in the fire of betrayal and truth. “I won’t let them keep it hidden,” she said at last.

Kael nodded, as if he had expected that answer. “Then you must be ready for what comes next.”

He stepped back into the shadows, leaving Sága with the weight of his words. She didn’t know what was coming, but she knew one thing: she could no longer remain a scavenger.

The chamber pulsed with light as Sága and Lyra stood before the crystalline core, their hands trembling slightly as they prepared to activate it. The air around them felt charged, like static building up before a storm. They had spent hours studying the ancient mechanisms, deciphering symbols that no one else had ever understood.

Lyra adjusted a control panel at the base of the core, her fingers moving with practiced precision. “This might not work,” she said, glancing at Sága. “But we have to try.”

Sága nodded, stepping forward and placing her palm against the crystal’s surface once more. The moment she did, the chamber shuddered. A low hum filled the air, growing louder as the core responded to her touch.

Then came the visions.

They were not just images—they were memories, fragments of a time that had been stolen from history. She saw Eternis before it was built, when the star still shone freely across the sky. People lived in harmony with its light, using it not as a tool for control but as a guide for growth and understanding.

She saw the Council arriving, their intentions cloaked in promises of progress and prosperity. They had promised to save the planet from ruin, to bring order where there was chaos. But instead, they had built a prison around the star, chaining its consciousness to the station and siphoning its power to sustain their rule.

And she saw what happened when they tried to control it too much—when they twisted its purpose beyond recognition. The star had resisted, its light flickering in pain as it was forced into servitude. It had screamed in silence, its voice drowned by the Council’s lies.

Sága gasped as the vision ended, her hands gripping the edge of the core. “It wasn’t a weapon,” she whispered. “It was a guardian.”

Lyra’s eyes were wide with understanding. “They’ve been lying about everything. The star was never meant to be used like this. It was meant to guide us, not control us.”

The chamber seemed to breathe around them, the light from the core flickering in time with their thoughts. Sága felt something inside her break—years of guilt and confusion giving way to clarity and purpose.

She turned to Lyra, her voice steady now. “We have to stop them. This isn’t just about power—it’s about freedom.”

Lyra looked at her, a mixture of awe and determination in her eyes. “Then we must face it. The Council will not let this go quietly.”

Sága nodded, her heart pounding with the weight of what she had uncovered. She had spent so long believing that the past was something to be ignored or rewritten for the sake of survival. But now, she knew better.

She had been part of the lie, but no longer.

The Reclaimers’ hideout was a place of quiet tension, its walls lined with maps and schematics that detailed every inch of Eternis’s structure. The air was thick with the scent of old metal and oil, mingling with the faint hum of machinery that still clung to life in this forgotten corner of the station.

Sága stood at the center of the room, clutching the data crystal she had taken from the Hidden Chamber. Her hands were steady, but her mind was a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions.

She looked around at the faces of those who had fought alongside her—faces that bore the weight of years spent in resistance. They had trusted her, followed her, and now they were waiting to hear what she had found.

“Eternis was built as a sanctuary,” she began, her voice carrying through the chamber. “Not as a prison. The star wasn’t meant to be a weapon—it was meant to guide us.”

A murmur of disbelief rippled through the group. Vaelin, who had been standing near the back, stepped forward, his gaze sharp with curiosity.

“You mean to say they’ve been lying about everything?” he asked.

Sága nodded. “They built Eternis not to control the star, but to trap it. They siphoned its energy not for progress, but for power. And in doing so, they destroyed what once was a place of balance.”

Lyra placed a hand on her shoulder, her voice steady. “We’ve known about the Council’s lies for a long time. But now we have proof.”

Sága looked at Lyra, then at Vaelin and the others. “The truth is more dangerous than they thought. It could destroy everything they’ve built.”

Vaelin folded his arms, his expression unreadable. “And what do you propose? That we simply expose them and hope for the best?”

Sága took a deep breath. “No. We have to free the star. If we don’t, the Council will continue their reign of lies, and the planet below will keep dying.”

A silence fell over the room, heavy with uncertainty.

Kael’s voice echoed in her mind, his words cutting through the tension like a blade. *Then we need you to act. The Council will not let this go quietly.*

Sága looked at the faces before her, knowing that each one carried their own fears and doubts. Some of them had spent years fighting for survival, not for truth. Others had lost everything to the Council’s tyranny.

But she knew what she had to do.

She stepped forward, placing the data crystal on the table. “This is our chance to change things. To stop the Council from using the star as a weapon. To return it to its rightful place.”

A few of the Reclaimers looked at her with cautious hope, while others remained skeptical. It was Lyra who finally spoke.

“We’ve always known that Eternis was more than just a structure. We’ve known that the Council’s control was built on lies. But we didn’t know how deep those lies ran.”

Sága met her gaze, determination burning in her chest. “Now we do. And if we don’t act, they’ll continue their deception until nothing is left but ruins and silence.”

She saw the flicker of understanding in Lyra’s eyes, the way Vaelin’s expression shifted from skepticism to resolve. She knew that this moment would define them all.

The Reclaimers had always fought for freedom, but now they had something more—something real. A truth that could not be buried.

And with that truth came a new path.

---

As the night deepened and the station’s lights flickered in the distance, Sága sat alone in the dim glow of her quarters, the data crystal resting on her lap like a burden she had finally carried.

The weight of what she had learned pressed against her chest. The Council had not just manipulated history—they had rewritten it entirely. They had turned a sanctuary into a prison, a guardian into a weapon, and a people into subjects.

She thought of her mentor, the one who had once believed in the Council’s vision of progress. He had tried to save Eternis, to protect the star from being consumed by their greed. But he had failed.

And now, she was the one who would try again.

Sága ran her fingers over the crystal, feeling its warmth against her skin. It pulsed with a life of its own, as if it knew what she was thinking.

She had spent so long trying to survive in a world that had been built on lies. Now, she had a choice—to continue living in the shadows or to step into the light and fight for something greater.

Her fingers tightened around the crystal. “I won’t let them win,” she whispered.

The past had shown her the truth, and now it was time to act.

She would not be a scavenger anymore. She would be a revolutionary.

And if that meant sacrificing everything she had once believed, then so be it.
