Jules Vidant staggered through the narrow passageway, his boots scraping against the damp stone floor of his hideout. The air was thick with the scent of mildew and old parchment, mingling with the faint metallic tang of blood from a recent skirmish in the city’s underbelly. He had just completed another smuggling run—this time for a shipment of enchanted glass that would fetch a fortune in the upper districts. It was supposed to be routine. But as he stepped into the dimly lit chamber, something felt wrong.

The lanterns flickered, casting jagged shadows across the walls lined with maps and half-finished contraptions. A single oil lamp sat on his desk, its flame wavering unnaturally, as if the air itself were resisting it. Jules reached for the artifact—wrapped in a cloth, resting on the center of the table—and hesitated. He had expected to feel relief, perhaps even pride, at having completed another job without incident. Instead, there was a hollow ache in his chest, like something had been removed.

He unrolled the cloth and stared at it. The artifact was no longer just a mirror—it was *alive*. Its surface shimmered with an inner light that pulsed in time with his own heartbeat. He reached out, but his fingers hovered just above it, as if afraid to touch something he no longer understood. A memory surfaced: the deal he had made, the price paid in silence and stolen magic, the way the buyer’s eyes had gleamed with greed. But now, it felt like a dream.

“Was that really me who made that deal?” he whispered, his voice barely audible over the hum of residual enchantment in the room. “Or did the mirror show me what I wanted to see?”

He sat down and ran his hand across the table, his fingers brushing against a stack of ledgers and journals. They were filled with notes from past jobs, names of clients, dates, locations. But as he flipped through them, something felt off. The handwriting was familiar, but not quite *his*. He looked at the pages again, then at his own reflection in the artifact’s surface. The eyes staring back were his, yet they seemed too sharp, too knowing.

He closed the ledger and leaned back, rubbing his temples. “I’m not sure if I’m Jules or something else…”

The words caught in his throat. A cold sweat broke out along his neck as he felt a shift inside him—something subtle but undeniable. He had always been careful with the artifact, keeping it hidden, using it only when necessary. But now, its influence was spreading like ivy through the cracks of his mind.

He wandered toward the window, where the city’s skyline loomed in the distance, a jagged silhouette against the moonlight. The streets below were alive with movement—merchants hawking wares, enforcers patrolling the alleys, nobles walking with their heads high. It was all so familiar, yet he felt as though he were watching it from a different angle, one that didn’t quite match his own.

A sharp knock at the door made him jump. He turned, but no one was there. The hideout was empty except for the echoes of his own thoughts. He pushed the door open and stepped into the alley, only to find himself standing in front of a mirror that wasn’t there before. It stood alone in the darkness, its frame ornate and ancient, reflecting not just his face but something deeper—something he didn’t recognize.

He reached out, but the image wavered. The reflection moved slightly before him, as if it were alive. Then, without warning, it spoke.

“You were meant to be more than this,” the voice echoed, smooth and melodic, yet filled with a weight that pressed against his skull like a stone. “You were born to see the truth.”

Jules stumbled back, his heart pounding. The words felt foreign, as if they had been spoken by someone else—someone he hadn’t met yet. He blinked, trying to steady himself. “Who are you? Am I even real anymore?”

The mirror cracked slightly, and a flicker of light danced across its surface. For a moment, the image changed. It wasn’t him—it was a younger version of himself, standing in a different place, a different time. The boy had been staring at the same artifact, but it had looked different then—less powerful, less dangerous.

“Why do I remember this?” Jules asked aloud, his voice trembling. “That’s not my life.”

The reflection didn’t answer. It simply stared back, its eyes hollow and knowing. Then, with a sudden shift in the air, the vision dissolved into static, and the mirror returned to its original form.

Jules exhaled sharply, his breath coming out in visible puffs. He had been through many illusions before—tricks of the mind that came from overusing the artifact—but this was different. This wasn’t a trick. It was something deeper, something that didn’t just play with his perceptions but *rewrote* them.

He turned away from the mirror and walked back into his hideout, trying to shake off the feeling that he had been watching himself from another life. But the artifact remained on the table, its glow steady and unrelenting. He couldn’t ignore it anymore.

The next morning, Jules awoke with a start, the same feeling of unease lingering in his chest. The hideout was quiet, save for the distant clang of metal and the occasional scuffle from the lower districts. He had been dreaming again—of a life that wasn’t his. A life where he hadn’t chosen to be a smuggler, where he hadn’t stolen magic from the desperate and sold it to the powerful.

He sat up, rubbing his eyes. The artifact was still there, wrapped in its cloth, waiting for him. He reached out again, but this time, instead of touching it, he looked at it with new scrutiny. It wasn’t just a mirror anymore—it was something else entirely.

The days that followed were restless. Jules found himself questioning everything: the names on his ledgers, the people he had once trusted, even the very act of smuggling itself. He had always justified it as survival, but now he felt like a puppet, pulled by unseen strings. The artifact wasn’t just revealing truths—it was *changing* him.

One night, as he sat alone in the dim light of his hideout, Jules decided to seek out Veyra. She had been one of the few people who had ever spoken to him without hesitation, and now, more than ever, he needed her insight.

He found her on a secluded rooftop, where the city’s magic was thin but still present. The workshop was hidden among the shadows, its entrance concealed by a curtain of vines that shimmered faintly in the moonlight. Veyra stood at the center of it all, her arms crossed, her eyes sharp with something between concern and curiosity.

“You’re not yourself,” she said without preamble, as if she had been waiting for him to come.

Jules hesitated. “I think I’ve been… seeing things. Memories that don’t belong to me. A different version of myself.”

Veyra stepped closer, her gaze piercing. “The artifact isn’t just a mirror, Jules. It’s a conduit. It feeds on the truth it shows you, and in doing so, it *changes* you. You think it’s revealing your past, but it’s showing you what you *want* to see.”

He frowned. “What does that mean?”

“It means you’re not just a smuggler anymore. You’re something else now—something more.” She gestured toward the artifact. “It’s not just reflecting reality; it’s *shaping* it. The city is built on theft, and you’ve been complicit in it for years. But this artifact—it doesn’t just show you what you did. It shows you what you could have done.”

Jules felt a chill run through him. “So… I’m not just being manipulated? I’m choosing this?”

Veyra shook her head. “No, Jules. You’re being *tested*. The artifact is trying to break you, to see if you can resist its pull. If you let it take over, you’ll become a part of the system—just like everyone else.”

He looked down at his hands, feeling the weight of her words settle in his bones. “Then how do I break free?”

Veyra studied him for a long moment before speaking. “You have to stop using it. But that’s not easy. You’ve been carrying this burden for too long. It’s become part of you.”

Jules clenched his jaw, frustration bubbling beneath the surface. “I don’t want to lose myself.”

Veyra sighed, her expression softening. “Then fight it. Or let it take you.”

The words hung between them like a curse. Jules left the rooftop that night with more questions than answers, but he knew one thing: the artifact was no longer just a tool. It had become something else—something dangerous.

He returned to his hideout and found himself drawn once more to the mirror. This time, it wasn’t just showing him fragments of another life; it was *pulling* him toward it. He reached out again, but this time, he didn’t touch it. Instead, he stepped back, forcing himself to remember why he had taken this path in the first place.

Smuggling had been a way to survive. It had given him a purpose when he had none. But now, that purpose felt hollow. The artifact had shown him what he was—a cog in a machine, a thief who had never truly stolen anything but magic itself.

The next day, Jules went to see Elian. He found the resistance leader in his backroom, surrounded by maps and whispered conversations. Elian looked up from his work as Jules entered, his expression unreadable.

“You’re not the same man who left that alley,” Elian said, his voice low but firm. “The artifact is changing you.”

Jules sat down, his hands gripping the edge of the table. “I know. But I don’t want to lose myself.”

Elian studied him for a moment before leaning forward. “Then fight it. Or let it take you.”

The words were similar to Veyra’s, but they carried more weight. Elian had seen what the artifact could do—how it twisted even the most well-intentioned minds into something unrecognizable.

“I’ve been seeing things,” Jules admitted, his voice barely above a whisper. “Memories that aren’t mine. A different version of me.”

Elian’s eyes darkened. “You were never just a smuggler, Jules. You were part of the system long before you ever picked up that first crate of stolen magic. The artifact is showing you what you’ve been avoiding all along.”

Jules felt a wave of nausea rise in his throat. He had always known he was complicit, but now it felt like something deeper was unraveling inside him. He looked at Elian, searching for answers.

“What do I do?” he asked, his voice trembling.

Elian hesitated before answering. “You have to decide who you want to be. The artifact won’t let you go until you make that choice.”

Jules left the room with a heavy heart, the weight of those words pressing against him like a stone. He had always believed himself to be a survivor, a man who had carved out his own path in a city that thrived on inequality. But now, he wasn’t sure if he was still the same man.

He wandered through the city streets, his mind racing with possibilities. The artifact had shown him different lives—different choices. He could have been a scholar, or a rebel, or something else entirely. But each vision came with its own cost. One life ended in poverty and regret; another in violence and bloodshed.

He found himself standing in front of the Exchange building again, though he hadn’t intended to. The towering structure loomed over him, its windows glowing with an unnatural light. He had always avoided it, but now he felt compelled to look inside.

The doors were sealed shut, as they always were. But the artifact pulsed in his pocket, as if it knew what he was thinking. He reached into his satchel and pulled it out, its surface reflecting the city’s skyline with an eerie clarity.

For a moment, he thought about using it again. About seeing more of the truth, more of the system. But something inside him resisted. The artifact had shown him too much already—enough to make him question everything he once believed.

He turned away from the Exchange and walked through the streets, his mind filled with uncertainty. He was no longer just a smuggler; he was something else now—something that could either break free or be consumed by the very thing he had been fighting against.

As he passed an alleyway, he caught a glimpse of himself in a shop window. The reflection looked different—older, more worn, with eyes that seemed to hold more weight than they should. He stared at it for a long moment before turning away.

That night, Jules returned to his hideout and sat in the dim light, the artifact resting on the table in front of him. He no longer felt the need to use it. Instead, he looked at it with something close to reverence.

The next morning, he awoke to a different world. The city was still there, but it felt *wrong*—as if it had shifted beneath his feet. He opened the ledger and found that the names had changed. Some were still familiar, but others were new. His own name was at the top of the list.

He looked at it, heart pounding. “I wasn’t just a smuggler. I was part of the system. All along.”

The realization hit him like a hammer to the skull. He had been complicit in the Exchange’s theft for years, and now the artifact was showing him that truth with undeniable clarity. It wasn’t just revealing what he had done—it was forcing him to face it.

He closed the ledger and stared at the artifact one last time. It didn’t speak this time, but its presence felt heavier than before, as if it were waiting for him to make a choice.

Jules stood and walked toward the door, his mind racing with questions. He had spent so long trying to survive that he had never stopped to ask *why*. Now, the artifact had given him an answer—but whether he would accept it or be consumed by it remained to be seen.

As he stepped out into the city’s streets, a new purpose stirred within him. The artifact was no longer just a tool of power; it was a mirror of truth, and he was beginning to see himself in it for the first time in years.

He didn’t know what came next, but one thing was certain: the world he had known was changing—and so was he.
