Jules Vidant moved through the tunnels like a shadow slipping between cracks in the city's foundation. The air was thick with dampness and the stench of rot, a constant reminder that he was far from the surface world where the lanterns flickered over cobblestones and merchants shouted their wares to the wind. His boots echoed against the stone walls, each step a silent vow to himself—*this job is just another one. Just another way to make coin. Don’t get caught up in this place again.* But the thought of turning back had never felt so heavy.

The smuggling job was simple enough: a crate of rare spices from the eastern markets, worth enough to buy a month’s worth of food for his family and enough to pay off the debts he’d accrued after last month’s shipment. The client had been vague about where the goods were going, but Jules didn’t need much more than that. He knew the city well enough by now to recognize the signs of trouble—unmarked doors, whispered names, the way certain alleys seemed to shift underfoot as if they remembered being something else once. This time, though, it was different. The crate had been delivered in a place he hadn’t seen before, deep beneath the old merchant quarter, where even the rats had long since abandoned their dens.

He’d followed the directions carefully, avoiding the patrols that roamed these lower levels like wolves through the fog. The tunnels were narrow and twisting, lined with rusted pipes and broken stone. His fingers brushed against the rough walls as he moved, a habit from months of navigating these forgotten places. The tunnels had become his second home, but this time, the silence pressed in like a hand around his throat. He hadn’t been here long enough for the city to forget him, yet something about this path felt different—too still, too deliberate. It wasn’t just the weight of his boots against the stone or the way the air clung to his skin like a second layer. It was the way the walls seemed to watch him, as if they remembered every step he’d taken since leaving the surface. He had no idea how much time had passed, but the thought of turning back had never felt so heavy. But something about this path felt wrong—too still, too quiet. He paused, listening for the usual sounds of the undercity: distant laughter, the clatter of metal, the hum of machinery. Nothing. Just silence.

Jules pulled his hood tighter around his face and pressed forward. The air grew colder as he descended deeper, the flickering light from his lantern barely enough to see past the dust that hung like a veil in the dimness. He reached a vast stone door, its surface cracked and worn, but still intact. It was sealed with an old sigil—something he hadn’t seen before. His hand hovered over it for a moment, then pressed against the cold metal. The door groaned open, revealing a chamber bathed in the pale light of his lantern.

Inside, the air was thick with something more than decay. It smelled of ancient incense and something metallic, like blood or iron. Jules stepped inside, his breath catching as he took in the sight before him. The walls were covered in murals, their colors long faded but still telling a story—of a city that had once been grander, with towers reaching into the sky and streets paved with gold. Now, they were ruins, forgotten by time and the people above. He ran his fingers over the nearest mural, tracing the figures of what looked like priests or scholars, their hands raised toward something unseen.

He moved deeper into the chamber, his lantern casting long shadows that danced across the stone. At the far end, resting on a pedestal of blackened marble, was an object that made his breath hitch. It looked like a sphere, no larger than his fist, encrusted with symbols that seemed to shift when he looked at them too long. The sphere pulsed beneath his fingers, as if alive. It wasn’t just warmth—he could feel it humming in his bones, a slow, steady rhythm that mirrored the beat of his own heart. The surface, though cool to the touch, seemed to vibrate with a presence that defied logic, as though the artifact itself was waiting for him. Jules pulled back slightly, but the sensation only deepened, wrapping around his thoughts like an unseen thread. It wasn’t just knowing him—it was remembering him. A cold realization settled in his chest: this wasn’t a simple object, nor was it a mere relic of a forgotten civilization. It was something else entirely, something that had been left behind with purpose, and now it was reaching out, as if the city’s buried sins had finally found a way to whisper their truth to someone who would listen.“This place is cursed,” he muttered, his voice barely above a whisper. “I should’ve turned back.”

But something in him—something deep and stubborn—refused to leave. He knelt before the pedestal, his hands trembling slightly as he reached out. The moment his fingers brushed against the artifact, it warmed beneath his touch, not just from the heat of his skin but from something deeper, something that made his pulse quicken and his thoughts blur.

“What is this... it’s warm. Like it knows me.”

The words left his lips before he could stop them, and as if in response, the sphere pulsed again. A low hum filled the chamber, resonating through the stone like a heartbeat. Jules staggered back, his heart pounding in his chest. The murals around him seemed to shift, the figures moving in slow motion, their eyes now glowing with an inner light. He blinked, and when he looked again, they were still.

The hum grew louder, filling the space between them until it was almost deafening. Then, without warning, the world around him dissolved into a cascade of colors and shadows. He felt himself being pulled downward, not by gravity but by something unseen—something that whispered to him in a language he didn’t understand yet somehow did.

When he opened his eyes again, he wasn’t in the chamber anymore. He was standing in the city at night, but it wasn’t the same city he knew. The streets were slick with rain, and the lanterns above flickered like dying stars. But what really struck him was the way the people moved—slower, heavier, as if burdened by something more than their own weight.

He saw them first: the workers in the lower districts, their backs bent under the weight of crates and chains, their faces lined with exhaustion. They were not just laborers; they were slaves to a system that thrived on their suffering. Their hands were calloused, their eyes hollow, and yet they worked without complaint, as if it were their fate to be broken.

Then he saw the merchants in the upper markets, their cloaks embroidered with gold thread, their voices raised in triumph over the goods they sold. Jules watched as the merchants in the upper markets, their cloaks stitched with gold and their voices thick with greed, haggled over the very same spices he had just smuggled through the shadows of the undercity. The scent of cinnamon and cloves was familiar, but now it carried a weight he hadn’t noticed before—a weight that pressed against his ribs like an unspoken truth. These spices, once traded in secret for profit, were now being sold as if they were nothing more than common goods, their origins erased, their cost forgotten. He had always known the undercity was a place of desperation, but this was different. This wasn’t just about survival; it was about exploitation, about how the city’s magic and resources were siphoned from the poor and given to the rich without a second thought. The workers below didn’t just toil—they were drained, their life force extracted to fuel the luxuries above. Jules clenched his fists, the artifact still warm in his grip, as if it had awakened something inside him. He had spent years running from responsibility, but now, standing at the crossroads of privilege and suffering, he realized that the city’s power wasn’t just in its towers or its wealth—it was in the way it kept people like him blind to the truth. Jules felt a sickening twist in his gut as he watched them trade without a second thought, as if the suffering of others was an afterthought.

He moved through the streets, not sure how he got there, but the city seemed to stretch endlessly in all directions. He passed a child who stared at him with wide, unblinking eyes, and then he saw it: a tower that loomed above the lower districts like a jagged tooth. Its spires reached into the sky, but its base was rooted in the very earth where the workers toiled. The tower pulsed with an eerie light, and Jules realized it wasn’t just a building—it was a source of power, one that drained from the people below.

The artifact in his hand glowed brighter now, its warmth spreading through his fingers like a current. He looked down at it, then back at the city. The hum had stopped, but something else had taken its place—a quiet, insistent voice in his mind, speaking in fragments.

“You see what they do not... the cost of their power.”

Jules didn’t understand the words, but he felt them settle into his bones like a warning. He turned away from the tower and started walking, his steps slower now, as if the city itself had slowed down to let him see. The workers still moved, but their faces were no longer just worn—they were desperate, angry, and resigned all at once.

He didn’t know how long he stayed in the vision, but when it finally pulled him back, he was gasping for air, his hands clutching the artifact as if it were a lifeline. The city above had always been a place of wealth and privilege, but now, through the artifact’s gaze, he saw it for what it truly was—a machine that fed on the suffering of the lower districts, its spires not just reaching toward the sky but siphoning life from those below. The workers were not just laborers; they were fuel, their magic extracted and sold without a thought, their pain turned into profit. He could feel the weight of this truth pressing against his ribs, heavier than any cargo he had ever carried. The artifact pulsed in his grip, its warmth now a fire that burned through his bones, not just with power but with purpose. It was no longer just an object—it was a mirror, reflecting the city’s hidden sins and whispering to him in a language of shadows and stone. He had seen the truth, and there was no turning back. The chamber was silent again, the murals still frozen in place, but Jules could feel something had changed within him.

He stumbled to his feet and looked around, the stone walls now familiar, the scent of decay grounding him in reality. But his mind was elsewhere—on the faces he’d seen, on the injustice that had been laid bare before him. He felt a strange weight in his chest, as if something had been lifted from him, but not in a good way.

The sphere pulsed faintly beneath his fingers, as if alive, its glow seeping into the cracks of the stone floor and curling around his wrist like a living thing. Jules exhaled sharply, his breath fogging in the cold air, but the warmth from the artifact was undeniable—radiating not just from its surface, but from some deeper, hidden source. He had expected to find treasure, something valuable to sell for coin, but this... this felt different. It wasn’t just an object; it was a tether to something ancient, something that had been waiting for him. The symbols on its surface shimmered, not with light, but with meaning, as if they had been carved by a hand that still remembered how to speak. He traced them again, his fingers trembling slightly, and the hum in the chamber deepened, resonating through his bones. "This isn’t just a trinket," he whispered, though the words felt like a confession rather than an observation. The artifact’s warmth spread through him, not as a simple heat, but as a pulse of something vast and unseen—something that had been buried beneath the city for centuries, and now, for the first time, was stirring. “It’s a key to something bigger.”

He reached into his coat and pulled out the small pouch of spices, now cold and useless. The job was over, but the artifact still pulsed in his grip, as if it had found its way back to him. He didn’t know what he would do with it, but he knew one thing: he couldn’t go back to the life he’d had before.

The air in the chamber seemed heavier now, and the silence more oppressive. Jules sat down on the cold floor, his fingers tightening around the sphere. He stared at it, trying to make sense of what he’d just seen. The city above was a place of wealth and privilege, but beneath it lay something else—something that had been hidden for too long.

He didn’t know how long he sat there, but when he finally stood, his legs felt weak, as if the weight of the world had pressed down on him. He looked around once more, then carefully placed the artifact in his satchel. It wasn’t just a tool anymore; it was something else entirely.

As he turned to leave, the door behind him groaned shut, sealing the chamber from the world above. Jules didn’t look back. He knew he’d never be able to return to the life he once had, not after what he’d seen. The city’s secrets were no longer just whispers in the dark—they were a truth that burned in his mind.

He moved through the tunnels again, this time with purpose, his steps no longer uncertain. The undercity was still dangerous, still full of traps and betrayal, but now it felt like something more—a path, a possibility. He had seen what the city hid, and he couldn’t unsee it.

When he finally emerged into the streets at dusk, the lanterns flickered overhead, casting long shadows over the uneven cobblestones. The city was alive with its usual noise—merchants hawking goods, children chasing each other through the alleys, the distant clang of metal from a blacksmith’s forge. But Jules moved through it like a man on edge, his eyes scanning the faces around him.

He had always thought of himself as just another cog in the machine, someone who made a living by moving things people didn’t want to see. But his hands had never been idle—when he wasn’t smuggling, they were painting, sketching the city’s forgotten corners in hues that told stories no one else would. The murals in this chamber, with their faded lines and silent figures, felt like echoes of his own work, as if the past had reached out through his art to whisper its secrets. And now, the artifact in his satchel pulsed with a rhythm that matched the brushstrokes of his dreams. His art wasn’t just a distraction—it was a language, a way to see beyond the surface, and perhaps, a key to unlocking the truth buried beneath the city’s foundations. But now, he felt something else—a sense of responsibility, a need to understand what had been revealed to him. The artifact was still warm in his satchel, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that it was watching him.

He walked for a while, his mind racing with questions. Who were those people in the vision? What did they mean by *the cost of their power*? And why had the artifact chosen him?

Jules found himself at the edge of the lower district, where the line between wealth and poverty blurred into something indistinct. He looked up at the towering buildings above, their lights gleaming like a cruel promise. For the first time in his life, he felt the weight of that promise—not as a burden, but as a call to action.

He didn’t know what would come next, but one thing was certain: this wasn’t just about profit anymore. It was about something greater, something that had been waiting for him all along.

And as he turned away from the city’s edge and back toward the familiar streets, he felt the artifact humming softly in his satchel, as if it knew what he was thinking.
