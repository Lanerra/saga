Jules discovers the Guardian, a mysterious figure who reveals the artifact's true nature as a mirror of truth rather than a tool of power, and learns that the city's magic system is built on theft and exploitation. The Guardian offers him a map to the hidden realms, where the stolen magic is hoarded, and challenges him to confront his complicity. Jules decides to break the cycle, accepting the responsibility and stepping into a new path of justice.
