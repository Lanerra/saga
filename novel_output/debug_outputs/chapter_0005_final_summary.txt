The team discovers the Veil of Drift Space Station's airlock marked with coordinates and the word *Skyfall*, linking it to the Loop and hinting at its origins. They uncover a time anchor and a message revealing the Loop was intentionally created as a failsafe, not an accident, and that the crew's final act was an attempt to contain it. Kaelen resolves to confront the past, leading them toward the Drift Nexus to seek the truth behind the Loop's design.
