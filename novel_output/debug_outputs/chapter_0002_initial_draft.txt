Sága moved through the narrow passageway with a cautious rhythm, her boots scraping against the cold metal floor as if it were the only thing keeping her grounded. The air was thick with dust and something else—something that made her skin prickle like static before a storm. It wasn’t just the decay of Eternis; it was the weight of secrets pressing down on her from every direction, like the station itself had been built to keep them buried.

She had spent years scavenging through the ruins, always staying clear of anything that might draw attention. But something in her gut had been telling her for weeks now—something she couldn’t ignore. The old maintenance tunnels, long abandoned and sealed off by the Council’s engineers, had a way of calling to her. It was as if the station remembered her, or maybe it remembered what she once was.

Now, with the faint hum of an ancient power cell in her ears, she reached the end of the tunnel. The air shifted here, colder, heavier. A door stood before her, rusted and half-buried in rubble. She pried it open with a crowbar, the metal groaning as if it had been waiting for this moment. Beyond it was a chamber bathed in an eerie blue light, flickering like a dying star.

The walls were lined with data slates—some cracked, some still glowing faintly with unreadable symbols. The floor was littered with dust and fragments of old machinery, its gears long since rusted into uselessness. In the center of the room, beneath a collapsed section of the ceiling, lay a sealed vault, its surface etched with glyphs that pulsed in time with the hum of the power cell.

She stepped closer, her breath catching as she realized what she was looking at. This wasn’t just another storage room or forgotten corridor—it was something more. A place where the Council had hidden their crimes, their lies, and the truth that they didn’t want anyone to know.

Her fingers brushed against the vault’s surface, and a low vibration ran through it. She hesitated, then pressed her palm against the cold metal. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, with a groan of resistance, the vault opened, revealing rows of sealed data cylinders and crystalline storage units that glowed like embers in the dark.

The silence was oppressive, broken only by the sound of dripping water from somewhere above. She stepped inside, her boots crunching over shattered glass and metal shavings. The air smelled of ozone and old parchment, a scent that made her heart race with both fear and anticipation.

She reached for one of the data cylinders, her hands trembling slightly as she fumbled with the lock. A soft chime echoed through the chamber, and suddenly, the walls came alive. Holographic projectors flickered to life, casting ghostly images of the past across the room—images that didn’t match what she had ever seen before.

She watched in stunned silence as the holograms revealed Eternis not as a beacon of progress but as a prison. The station’s design wasn’t just for energy siphoning; it was built to suppress the planet below, to keep its people from questioning the Council’s authority. The star’s light had never been salvation—it had been a tool of control.

“This place... it's been sealed for years,” she whispered to herself, her voice barely audible over the hum of the machines. She didn’t know why the Council had hidden this, but now that she saw it, she understood why they feared her finding it.

The data slates around her began to glow in response to her presence. She ran her fingers across them, reading what was written in a language that felt both ancient and familiar. It was the same script used by the Council, but with words she hadn’t seen before—words like *fracture*, *corruption*, and *sacrifice*.

As she read, a cold dread settled over her. The logs detailed how the star’s energy had been siphoned for decades, causing irreversible damage to the world below. Entire cities had crumbled under the weight of its pull, and people had vanished without a trace. The Council had called it *progress*, but it was nothing more than a slow, deliberate erasure of life.

She pressed her palm against one of the data slates, and suddenly, the holographic images shifted. A new projection appeared—a map of Eternis, its surface marked with red lines that pulsed like veins. The star above was no longer just a source of power; it was a leech, feeding on the planet’s life force.

“This isn’t progress,” she muttered, her voice trembling. “It’s destruction disguised as advancement.”

She didn’t know how long she stood there, staring at the images, but when she finally pulled herself away, the weight of what she had seen pressed down on her like a mountain. She turned back to the data slates, now glowing more brightly, and began to search for something—anything—that could help her understand the full extent of the Council’s deception.

She found it in the form of an old access panel hidden behind a collapsed section of wall. With careful precision, she pried it open and inserted a small device she had salvaged from a previous scavenging mission. The machine whirred to life, its interface blinking with unreadable symbols until she managed to activate a decryption sequence.

The chamber darkened as the system engaged, and then—like the stars themselves—light burst through the air. A holographic archive unfolded before her, displaying decades of records that had been erased from history. She saw reports of failed experiments, warnings ignored, and entire populations displaced under the guise of “improvement.”

The deeper she dug, the more she felt like she was unraveling something vast and terrible. The Council hadn’t just lied about the star’s purpose—they had rewritten the past, ensuring that no one would ever question their authority.

She reached for a small data crystal from her satchel, its surface smooth and cold. She knew it wasn’t enough to hold all the information she had uncovered, but it would be a start. Carefully, she inserted it into the decryption interface, watching as the crystal pulsed with light, absorbing the data.

As the last of the records faded, she stepped back from the console, her heart pounding. The truth was no longer just a whisper in the shadows—it was something she could carry with her, something that would change everything.

But she wasn’t alone in this place. A sudden noise made her freeze. She turned sharply, her hand instinctively reaching for the small energy blade she had hidden beneath her cloak. The chamber had been silent before, but now—now there was a sound like footsteps, slow and deliberate.

She crouched behind one of the data slates, pressing herself into the shadows as the lights flickered again. A figure emerged from the darkness, cloaked in a dark, flowing robe that seemed to absorb the light around it. Their face was obscured by a mask of polished metal, but their presence was unmistakable.

Sága’s breath caught in her throat. She had expected someone—anyone—to come for her. But she hadn’t expected them to be *here*.

“Do you know what you’ve found?” the figure asked, their voice low and measured, like a blade being sharpened.

Sága didn’t answer immediately. Her mind raced, trying to figure out who this was. She had heard stories of Council enforcers—silent, unseen, always watching. But she had never seen one in person.

“I know what they’ve done,” she said finally, her voice steady despite the fear curling in her stomach.

The figure stepped closer, their movements silent and precise. “Then you understand the danger.”

Sága’s grip tightened on the data crystal. “I understand that I can’t let them continue.”

The enforcer tilted their head slightly, as if considering her words. Then, without warning, they lunged. Sága barely had time to react, twisting away from the strike and knocking over a nearby console. The lights flickered violently, and for a moment, the chamber was plunged into darkness.

She ran, heart pounding in her chest. Behind her, the enforcer’s footsteps echoed through the tunnels like thunder. She ducked into a side passage, the air thick with dust and the scent of ozone. Her breath came in short gasps as she pressed herself against the wall, trying to steady herself.

The tunnel was narrow, but she knew it well. It led to the old maintenance shaft that connected to the surface. If she could get out, she might have a chance.

She moved quickly, her fingers brushing against the cold metal of the walls as she navigated through the maze of tunnels. The enforcer’s pursuit was relentless, their presence like a shadow that refused to be cast aside.

Then, just as she reached the shaft, she heard it—a sound that made her stop dead in her tracks. A voice, calm and knowing, echoed from above.

“You shouldn’t have come here.”

Sága turned sharply, her hand on the blade. “Who are you?”

The figure stepped into the light of a flickering power cell, revealing their face for the first time. It was someone she recognized—someone who had once worked alongside her in the Council’s maintenance teams.

“Kael,” they said, their voice laced with something that wasn’t quite anger, but not quite kindness either. “You were always too curious for your own good.”

Sága’s stomach twisted. Kael had been one of the few people she had trusted, someone who had once believed in the Council’s mission as much as she did. Now, he stood before her, a silent witness to everything she had uncovered.

“I didn’t come here to be caught,” she said, stepping back into the shadows. “I came to find the truth.”

Kael studied her for a moment, then nodded slowly. “Then you’ve already lost.”

Sága’s eyes narrowed. “No. I still have the data.”

For a brief moment, Kael looked almost relieved. Then their expression hardened.

“Then you’ll need more than that,” they said. “You’ll need allies.”

She didn’t know what to say. The weight of the truth she had uncovered was heavier than she had ever imagined. And now, standing before someone who had once been part of the Council, she realized that her fight wasn’t just against the station—it was against the very foundation of the world she thought she knew.

“I’ll find them,” she said at last, her voice firm. “No matter what it takes.”

Kael stepped back into the shadows, their presence fading like a ghost. “Then you must be ready to pay the price.”

Sága didn’t respond. She had already made her choice. The truth was no longer something she could ignore—it was something she had to fight for.

She slipped through the maintenance shaft and emerged onto the cold surface of Eternis, the stars above burning with a light that felt both distant and cruel. The weight of the data crystal in her hand was more than just physical; it was a burden she now carried for the world below.

As she moved through the ruins, her mind raced with possibilities. She had to find someone who could help her spread the truth, someone who would believe her when she said that the Council’s so-called progress was nothing but destruction in disguise.

She knew there were others like her—others who had seen the cracks in the Council’s story and had chosen to ignore them. But now, with the evidence in her hands, she could no longer turn away.

The cost of historical revisionism had been made clear to her. And she was determined to pay it—not with silence, but with action. Not with guilt, but with truth.

She wasn’t just a scavenger anymore. She was something else entirely. A revolutionary, perhaps. Or maybe just a woman who had finally seen the light.

And now, that light would guide her through the darkness.
