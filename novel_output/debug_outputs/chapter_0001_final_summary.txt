Jules discovers an ancient, pulsating artifact in a hidden chamber beneath the city, which reveals the truth about the city's exploitation of its lower districts. The object, once just a tool for profit, now feels alive and connected to him, awakening a sense of responsibility and purpose he hadn't known before. He realizes he can no longer ignore the city's secrets and must confront the injustice he has long been complicit in.
