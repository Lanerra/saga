Elira Voss, once a leader of a cult that imposed a hive mind on its followers, returns to the abandoned temple to uncover the truth behind its teachings and the hidden library beyond reality's edge, where knowledge and truth are preserved but at a great cost. She confronts her past, realizing the hive mind was a prison rather than a gift, and decides to break free from its control. With determination, she follows ancient symbols to the library, ready to face whatever lies beyond the threshold.
