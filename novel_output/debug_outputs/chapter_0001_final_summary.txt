Elira Voss receives a crucial commission from the Patron to build a structure that can purify the poisoned air of the desert, which challenges her belief in architecture as a means of control and forces her to reconsider her approach. She initially struggles with the task, but after facing the harsh reality of the desert's resistance, she shifts to a more harmonious design that works with the environment rather than against it. The council begins to accept her new vision, recognizing the need for balance and understanding over domination.
