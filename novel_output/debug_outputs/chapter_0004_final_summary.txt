Jules discovers the Grand Arcane Exchange is a system of control that siphons magic from the lower districts to sustain the elite's power, revealing his own complicity as an enforcer. Confronted by Elian, a disillusioned former mage, he realizes his role in the exploitation and vows to break the chains. The artifact, now a symbol of truth and resistance, guides him toward a ledger exposing the names of those who profited from the system, including himself, setting him on a path to rebellion.
