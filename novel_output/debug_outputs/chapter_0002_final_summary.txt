Elara Voss arrives at a cursed valley, where the supernatural presence is overwhelming and the past and present are entangled in an endless cycle of suffering. The valley, once a place of solitude for her, now reveals itself as a prison built by the ancient Keepers of the Veil to contain the echoes of the dead, and she realizes she has been part of this cycle through her manipulation of spirits and the Machine. Standing before the Machine, she confronts her past actions and chooses to embrace her new role as a guardian rather than a manipulator.
