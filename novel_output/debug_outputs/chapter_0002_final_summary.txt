Kaelen discovers a hidden message from his presumed-dead crew within the derelict signal relay, revealing Project Echo as a survival mission tied to the Lunar Loop Colony Eternity. The archive exposes the Loop as a deliberate time mechanism designed to preserve humanity, not an accident, and implicates the Chrono Syndicate as its curators. Kaelen confronts a mysterious figure who reveals he was never meant to be alone and that the Veil Nexus holds the key to understanding the truth, forcing him to face his past and embrace a new purpose.
