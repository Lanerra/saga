Sága stepped into the dimly lit living room of her family home, the stolen memory cache clutched tightly in her hands. The air was thick with the scent of old wood and something more elusive—fear, perhaps. Her mother sat by the window, her gaze fixed on the street beyond, as if waiting for something to happen. Or someone.

“I won’t let them take what’s mine,” Sága said, her voice low but firm. She placed the cache on the table between them, its soft glow casting shadows across the worn furniture. Her mother didn’t look at it. Didn’t even blink.

“You’re not thinking clearly,” her mother murmured, her fingers tracing the edge of the fabric on the armrest. “They’ll take everything if you resist.”

Sága’s jaw tightened. She had spent years watching her family trade fragments of their past for another day, another breath, another chance to survive in a city that thrived on forgetting. Her mother had sold the memory of Sága’s first birthday, the one where she had laughed and clapped as her father danced with her. Her father had traded away the sound of her lullabies, the warmth of her childhood hands.

But now, Sága had something they didn’t. Proof.

She reached for the cache again, but her mother’s voice stopped her cold.

“You don’t understand what you’re doing,” she said, her tone not angry, but sorrowful. “They have a way of making people disappear—not just their memories, but their very selves.”

Sága’s hands curled into fists. “Then let them try.”

The next night, the kitchen table was cold and silent. The only sound was the ticking of the old clock above it, its hands frozen at midnight. Sága sat across from her father, his face lined with exhaustion. He had always been a man of quiet strength, but now he looked broken.

“You sold my memories?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Her father flinched, then nodded. “I had no choice. The Exchange is the only way we survive.”

Sága’s heart pounded in her chest. She thought of the memory cache in her room, of the lives it contained—lives that had been erased, rewritten, stolen. And now her own memories had been traded away like currency.

“You sold me,” she said, her voice rising. “You sold my childhood. My mother’s laughter. My sister’s face when I first learned to ride a bike.”

Her father looked down at his hands, trembling slightly. “I did what I had to do. You know that.”

She didn’t answer. She only stared at him, feeling the weight of everything he had taken from her.

The next morning, she found her sister in her bedroom, surrounded by neural interface devices and glowing screens. The room was sterile, almost clinical, filled with the soft hum of machines. Her sister sat cross-legged on the floor, eyes closed, a thin wire running from her temple to a device that pulsed with light.

“You’re not yourself anymore,” Sága said, stepping into the room.

Her sister’s eyes fluttered open. “I don’t want to be.”

Sága’s breath caught. She had always known something was wrong with her sister—how she spoke in clipped sentences, how she seemed to forget things too easily. But now, looking at her, it was undeniable. The implants were not just filling gaps; they were replacing her.

“I want to remember,” the sister whispered. “But I don’t know how.”

Sága sat beside her, reaching out but hesitating before touching her shoulder. “You can. We can.”

Her sister looked away. “I’ve lost too much already.”

That night, Sága sat in her quarters, the blue glow of her neural interface casting strange shadows on the walls. She had spent hours trying to block the siphon’s access, but each time she attempted it, a warning flashed across her vision: *You are not authorized to modify your neural interface.*

She clenched her teeth. “I won’t let them control me.”

The system didn’t care. It only followed orders.

She thought of Aelric, the man from the Outskirts who had helped her escape the Vault with the stolen cache. He had told her he was working on breaking the Exchange’s hold, that others were fighting too. She needed to find him again.

In the hidden workshop behind a rusted warehouse in the Outskirts, Aelric greeted her with a weary smile. The air smelled of burnt circuitry and old paper. Blueprints covered every surface, and strange devices hummed softly in the background.

“You’re not the only one fighting,” he said, his voice low. “I’ve seen what they do. I won’t let it happen again.”

Sága nodded, her heart pounding with a new kind of hope. She had spent too long believing she was alone, that no one else cared about what was being taken. But now, she knew better.

That night, Sága’s mother found the cache in the basement. The data logs were scattered across the floor, their glow casting eerie reflections on the walls. Her mother stood frozen, her face pale.

“You’re making it worse,” she said, voice trembling.

“I’m trying to save what’s left of us,” Sága replied, stepping forward.

Her mother looked at her, eyes filled with something between fear and guilt. “You don’t understand what you’re risking.”

“I understand perfectly,” Sága said. “I’ve seen what they do.”

The next day, she confronted her father again, this time in the alley behind their home. Flickering neon signs cast shifting shadows across the pavement as he met her gaze.

“You’re helping them?” she asked, her voice sharp with accusation.

Her father’s expression was unreadable. “I have to. They’ll kill us if I don’t.”

Sága shook her head. “You’re not helping us. You’re selling us out.”

She turned and walked away, the weight of betrayal pressing down on her chest.

Back in her sister’s bedroom, Sága stood before her once more. The room was now a mix of past and present—memories flickering across the walls like ghosts.

“You don’t have to be controlled,” she said, her voice steady. “You can fight back.”

Her sister looked at her, eyes filled with something Sága had never seen before: fear.

“I can’t,” she whispered. “I’ve lost too much.”

But Sága didn’t leave. She stayed until the memory cache was fully integrated into her neural interface, until she could feel its power coursing through her. It was a dangerous act—modifying her system without authorization—but she had no choice.

“This is my choice,” she whispered to herself as she worked.

If they found out, they’d erase her too.

The family dinner table that night was tense. Her mother and father exchanged glances, their eyes lingering on Sága as if trying to discern something new in her. She didn’t look at them, didn’t let them see the change within her.

“You’ve been acting strange,” her father said finally.

Sága met his gaze, steady and unflinching. “I’m not the same person anymore.”

The air between them crackled with unspoken words. With fear. With guilt.

That night, the Memory Enforcers came. They arrived without warning, their dark uniforms blending into the shadows of the Walled City. Her mother was dragged away before Sága could do anything, her screams echoing through the streets as the enforcers vanished into the darkness.

“They’ll take her memories,” Sága whispered to herself, tears burning in her eyes. “They’ll take everything.”

She couldn’t lose anyone else.

The next morning, she stood at the towering entrance of the Memory Vault, its doors sealed tight and guarded by armed enforcers. The air was cold, thick with the weight of history and loss. She had come to confront the Council, to show them that the truth could not be buried.

“You can’t erase what I’ve seen,” she said, her voice carrying across the square. “You can’t take what I remember.”

A council member stepped forward, his face impassive. “You don’t understand the cost of truth.”

Sága didn’t flinch. She had already paid that price.

She turned and walked away, but not before finding the hidden archive room deep within the Vault’s depths. Dust coated the floor, and old data files lay scattered around her. As she sifted through them, one memory caught her eye—a fragment of herself, from a time when she had been part of the resistance.

“I remember now,” she whispered, tears streaming down her face. “They erased me, but not completely.”

Outside, the city continued its endless cycle of trade and forgetfulness. But inside Sága, something had changed. She was no longer a passive participant in the system. She was a rebel, a fighter, and for the first time, she felt truly alive.

She turned to leave, her heart pounding with resolve.

“I can’t save them all,” she told herself as she stepped into the unknown. “But I can save myself.”
