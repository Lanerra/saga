The Archive Vaults pulsed with a cold, synthetic rhythm—a heartbeat of data and decay. Sága Vorn stood before the terminal, her fingers hovering over the interface as if it might bite her. The air was thick with ozone, the scent of something metallic clinging to her skin like a second layer. This place had always been a cathedral of memory, where the past was mined like ore, but tonight, it felt different. It felt alive, and that was a dangerous thing.

She had accessed the hidden folder by mistake—or perhaps not. The system had resisted her at first, its firewalls shifting like sand beneath her fingertips. But she knew how to manipulate the architecture of the Memory Exchange, had spent years learning the language of data and silence. With a few precise keystrokes, the folder unraveled before her, revealing files with names that made no sense: *The First Erasure*, *Subject 007-Alpha*, *Echoing Heart Subroutine*. These were not memories meant for trade, nor even records of transactions. They were remnants—unaccounted fragments of lives that had been swallowed whole.

Her breath caught as she opened the first file. It wasn’t a memory in the traditional sense; it was a scene. A city, not Eterna Prime, but something older, more primitive. People stood in lines, their faces hollow, their eyes glazed with a kind of quiet resignation. The air shimmered with something like static, and then the screen changed. It showed the process—neural siphoning machines descending upon individuals, extracting not just recollections, but entire consciousnesses. Those who resisted were silenced, their voices lost in the hum of the extraction coils.

Sága’s hands trembled. This can’t be real… they’re not just erasing people, they’re imprisoning them in memories.

She leaned back from the screen, her mind racing. How many others had been taken like that? How many names had been erased from the city’s history, their lives reduced to bits and bytes stored in the dark corners of the Vaults? Her entire life had been built on the premise that memory was a currency, a trade, an exchange. But this—this was something else entirely.

Her internal conflict gnawed at her like a virus. She had always believed in the system, had justified its cruelty with the logic that it was necessary, that without it, no one would live long enough to see the future. But now, as she stared at the memory before her, she saw not a future, but a prison.

She closed the file and exhaled slowly, trying to steady herself. The truth had always been a risk, but this… this was something greater than any of them could have imagined. If she left this alone, if she turned away now, she would be complicit in the annihilation of countless souls.

No. She couldn’t do that.

The terminal blinked at her, waiting for her next command. Sága reached out and opened another file. This one was labeled *Project Genesis*. Inside were schematics of a city rising from the ruins of something else, its foundations built not on stone or steel, but on the very essence of human recollection. The Memory Exchange wasn’t just an institution—it was the core of Eterna Prime itself.

A new fear settled in her chest. If this was true, then they weren’t just trading memories. They were building a city on stolen identities, on forgotten souls. She had been a part of it all along.

She needed to copy this memory. To take it out. To show someone—anyone—that the system wasn’t what they thought it was.

The copying process was delicate. Neural siphoning was not something that could be done without consent, but she had bypassed the usual protocols. She used a data crystal, one of the old ones from before the Memory Exchange’s digital reforms, and inserted it into the terminal. The screen flickered, and for a moment, the memory seemed to resist her, as if aware of what she was doing.

Then, with a hiss of compressed air and the soft chime of a system override, the transfer began. She could feel the weight of the memory pressing against her mind, its presence a whisper on the edges of her consciousness. It wasn’t just data—it was *life*, fractured and frozen in time.

A red light flared above her head. Her heart leapt into her throat. The system had detected her unauthorized access.

*No. No. No.*

She yanked the crystal from the terminal, her pulse roaring in her ears. The alarm screeched through the Vaults, a shrill sound that echoed against the metallic walls like the wail of a lost soul. She ran, her boots pounding against the cold floor, past rows of memory storage pods that pulsed with stolen recollections.

I can’t let this go back into the system.

She ducked behind a shelf, pressing herself against the curved surface of a pod. A siphoning drone hovered nearby, its red eyes scanning the area with mechanical precision. It was designed to detect anomalies in the flow of memory data, to flag any unauthorized access before it could be transmitted beyond the Vaults. If it found her, if it detected the crystal she had just removed…

She swallowed hard, her mind racing through the labyrinthine corridors she had memorized over the years. There had to be a way out. She had come here with a plan, hadn’t she? A hidden route through maintenance tunnels, one that bypassed surveillance drones and automated sentinels.

But now, the weight of what she had seen settled on her shoulders like an iron yoke. The system was not just controlling memories—it was erasing people, rewriting history, and she had been a part of it.

She turned a corner, her breath shallow, her eyes darting to every shadow. The corridors were lined with memory storage units, each one containing a life that had once been lived. She could almost hear them whispering, their fractured recollections trapped in the cold embrace of data threads. Some of these memories were hers. Some of them belonged to people she had known, had traded with, had watched walk away from their own pasts.

She had never questioned it before. Never thought that those transactions might be more than just a means to an end. But now, as the echoes of the forbidden memory pulsed through her mind, she felt like a ghost walking among the living.

The sound of footsteps echoed behind her—too fast, too close. She sprinted down the corridor, her heart hammering against her ribs. A drone swooped low, its sensors sweeping the area with an almost predatory instinct. It was not just scanning for data breaches; it was scanning *her*.

They’re not just looking for memories—they’re looking for me.

She ducked into a maintenance tunnel, the air thick with the scent of old circuitry and damp metal. The walls were slick with condensation, and the flickering lights cast jagged shadows that danced like specters at her heels. Her breath came in ragged gasps as she pressed her back against the wall, heart pounding, mind reeling.

She had always thought herself efficient, detached. That was how you survived in the Memory Exchange. You didn’t let the memories get to you, didn’t let the weight of what you were doing settle in your bones. But now, every step she took felt like a betrayal, not just of the system, but of her own humanity.

She had seen what they were doing. She had touched it, held it in her hands. And she couldn’t turn away.

The tunnel opened into the lower districts of Eterna Prime, where the memory-lamps flickered weakly, their glow dimmed by the weight of the city’s collective loss. Her quarters were just a few blocks away, but every step felt like walking through a minefield. She was not just running from the system—she was running from herself.

She reached her door, breathless and trembling, and slid inside. The room was small, sterile, and illuminated by a single overhead light that buzzed faintly. It was the kind of place where memories were traded, not kept.

Lira stood in the center of the room, her face pale, her hands gripping the edge of the terminal as if it might anchor her to reality.

“They took my memory, Sága,” Lira said without looking up. “I don’t remember who I was.”

Sága’s throat tightened. She had not expected this. Not here. Not now. Her sister had always been a quiet presence, but in that moment, she felt like the weight of the world had settled on her shoulders.

“I didn’t think it would affect you too,” Sága replied, stepping forward cautiously. “I thought they’d just take the memory.”

Lira turned to face her, eyes wide with something between fear and confusion. “It wasn’t just a memory. It was *me*. I don’t know who I am anymore. I can’t remember my first day of school, or the way Mom used to laugh, or even your name.”

Sága’s heart stopped. She had known that the Memory Tax could be dangerous, but she had never imagined it would strip Lira of her very identity.

She reached out, hesitating for only a moment before taking her sister’s hand. “It’s not too late,” she said softly. “We can still find a way to get it back.”

Lira shook her head. “They don’t let you take back what they’ve taken. You’re supposed to just forget. To move on.”

Sága felt the words like a blade. She had taught Lira that, hadn’t she? Hadn’t she once told her that memories were just things to be traded, that it was better to lose one than to be burdened by them?

She didn’t have an answer now.

Instead, she pulled out the data crystal and placed it on the terminal. “This is what they’ve been hiding from us,” she said. “They’re not just trading memories, Lira. They’re erasing people. Whole lives.”

Lira stared at the crystal, then at Sága. “You saw it?” Her voice was barely a whisper.

“I did.” Sága nodded. “And I’m not going to let them do it anymore.”

She initiated the playback, and the memory unfolded before them like a wound being reopened. The city she had known all her life appeared in fragments—its spires built on human recollections, its systems sustained by stolen identities. And then, there was the final image: a group of people, their faces blurred, standing before a panel of figures who looked more like gods than humans.

Lira gasped as the memory played out. “I feel like I’m waking up from a dream,” she whispered, her fingers trembling against the edge of the terminal.

Sága watched her sister closely. She had always thought Lira was too young to understand the full weight of what they did. But now, with that memory burning in her eyes, Sága knew that wasn’t true. Lira had been watching all along, just like she had.

She reached out and touched her sister’s shoulder. “You’re not dreaming, Lira. This is real.”

The terminal blinked as the playback ended, and the room was suddenly too quiet. Lira looked at Sága with an expression that was both terrified and determined. It was a look that mirrored the one she had seen in herself just days ago.

“I remember now,” Lira said slowly. “I don’t know how, but I do. I remember feeling… something. Like there was more to me than what they wanted me to keep.”

Sága felt a flicker of hope. “Then we have to fight for it.”

Kael’s terminal buzzed with an incoming alert. The message appeared in red letters: *Unauthorized access detected—Subject Vorn, Sága. Locate and neutralize.* He stared at the screen, his fingers hovering over the keyboard as if unsure whether to hit delete or deny.

He had always been cautious. That was why he was still here, still working for the Guilds, still alive. But now, as the warning scrolled across his screen, he felt something shift in him. A memory from years ago surfaced unbidden: a client who had come in with a broken mind, begging to be allowed to keep just one more recollection before they took everything.

He had said no then. He had justified it. But what if that was the wrong choice?

You shouldn’t have gone there, Sága.

The words echoed in his mind as he typed a response, though he wasn’t sure who he was trying to convince—Sága, or himself.

“I didn’t think they’d find out so fast,” she had said. And now, here he was, watching the system flag her for something she hadn’t even finished doing.

He knew what would happen if the Enforcers caught her. They wouldn’t just erase her memories—they would erase *her*. She would become one of the Forgotten, wandering the Hollow Expanse with no recollection of who she once was.

The thought made his stomach twist.

Kael stood from his chair and walked to the window of his office, which overlooked the Memory Trade Square. He could see the city pulsing with its usual rhythm, but now it felt hollow. The people moved like ghosts, their faces lit by the glow of memory-lamps that held only fragments of their pasts.

He had always believed that the system was necessary, that without it, the city would fall into chaos. But what if the chaos wasn’t in the system itself, but in the way they used it? What if the Memory Exchange wasn’t a sanctuary for longevity, but a prison built on stolen recollections?

He turned back to his terminal and typed one final message: *I know what they’re doing. I just didn’t think I could do anything about it.*

It was the truth, and he knew that when Sága read it, she would understand that he wasn’t just warning her—he was reaching out.

The Memory Trade Square was a cacophony of voices, the hum of neural siphoning machines blending with the murmurs of traders and clients. Sága moved through the crowd as if she were invisible, the data crystal hidden in the folds of her coat. She had no intention of being seen, but the weight of what she carried made it hard to breathe.

She spotted Kael across the square, his face pale against the glow of the memory-lamps. He was watching her, and she could feel the unspoken warning in his gaze. She stepped closer, her mind racing with the implications of their conversation.

“You’ve put us all at risk,” Kael said, his voice low but firm.

Sága met his eyes, unflinching. “I know what they’re doing. I just didn’t think I could do anything about it.”

Kael exhaled sharply, then glanced around the square as if the very air might betray them. “You don’t understand,” he said. “Once you’re marked, there’s no turning back. They’ll find you, and when they do, you won’t be able to run anymore.”

Sága felt the weight of his words but didn’t falter. “Then I guess it’s time I stopped running.”

Kael shook his head, a mixture of fear and something else—something like hope. “You don’t know what you’re dealing with. They have ways of making sure people don’t remember things they shouldn’t.”

“I’ve seen them,” Sága said quietly. “And I’m not afraid anymore.”

She turned to leave, but Kael’s voice stopped her. “There are others,” he said. “People who know what you found. People who might help you if you need it.”

Sága hesitated. She had spent so long believing that she was alone in this, that the system was too vast, too entrenched to be challenged. But now, as Kael’s words settled in her chest like a spark, she realized something: the truth was already out there, waiting for someone to light it.

She nodded once and disappeared into the crowd.

Back at the maintenance area of the trade center, Sága worked quickly, her hands steady despite the chaos that had erupted behind her. The siphoning machines were malfunctioning, their screens flickering with corrupted data, their extraction coils sparking dangerously. Traders shouted in confusion as memories spilled from the machines, some falling into the laps of clients who didn’t know what to do with them.

She slipped the crystal into the back of a siphoning machine, slotting it into a maintenance port that would be overlooked amidst the noise. The machine groaned as it registered the foreign data, its internal systems struggling to process the forbidden memory. A warning light flashed red across its screen, and then—nothing.

Sága held her breath. If the system detected the crystal, it would trigger a lockdown. But if the machine was damaged enough, it might not even register that something had been inserted.

I can’t let this fall into their hands.

She watched as the machine’s lights flickered violently before going dark. The chaos around her continued, but she knew that for just a moment longer, the forbidden memory would be safe. Just a moment longer.

The sound of approaching boots made her flinch. She turned, heart pounding, and saw an enforcer moving through the crowd with mechanical precision. His uniform was sleek, his eyes scanning every face as if he could see through them to the memories they carried.

She ducked behind a stack of old siphoning units, her breath shallow. The man moved closer, his hand reaching for the nearest machine. She had no choice now—she had to run.

As she slipped into the shadows and disappeared into the labyrinth of the trade center, the enforcer’s voice echoed through the room: “Who tampered with this unit? I can see the trace.”

But Sága was already gone, her heart a drumbeat in her ears. She had caused chaos, yes—but she had also planted a seed. One that might take root and grow into something greater than herself.

She reached the maintenance tunnels beneath the city, her mind still reeling from what she had done. The air here was thick with dust and the scent of old wires, and the flickering lights cast long shadows on the walls. She had always known this place, had walked through it countless times while making repairs to the siphoning machines. But tonight, it felt like a different kind of sanctuary.

She found Kael waiting for her in a hidden room, his face drawn, his posture tense. “You caused a lot of noise,” he said as she entered, his voice low. “They’re going to be looking for you now.”

Sága nodded, pulling the crystal from her coat and placing it on the terminal between them. “I know what they’re doing,” she said. “They’re not just trading memories. They’re erasing people. Whole lives.”

Kael stared at the crystal, then at Sága. “You’ve seen it.”

“I have.” She met his gaze. “And I can’t unsee it. I won’t.”

He reached for the crystal, hesitating for only a moment before taking it. The screen flickered as he initiated the playback, and the memory unfolded before them again. This time, Kael didn’t look away.

“This isn’t just control,” he said after a long silence. “It’s annihilation. They’re not preserving memories—they’re destroying them.”

Sága felt something shift inside her. She had thought she was alone in this, that she had been the first to see the truth of the Memory Exchange. But now, Kael stood beside her, his voice steady with conviction.

“We have to expose this,” Sága said. “But how?”

Kael’s hands tightened around the terminal. “I don’t know,” he admitted. “I’ve spent years watching from the sidelines, not wanting to be the one who got caught. But now… I think I’m ready to stop being a spectator.”

The room was silent for a long moment, the weight of their words pressing down on them both. Then, from outside, the sound of approaching footsteps grew louder.

“They’re closing in,” Kael said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Sága’s breath came fast and shallow. “Then we don’t have much time.”

She turned to him, her eyes searching his face for any sign of doubt. But there was none. Only resolve.

“We have to find a way out,” she said. “And we have to do it before they erase everything we’ve worked for.”

The Archive Vaults pulsed with a cold, synthetic rhythm—a heartbeat of data and decay. Sága Vorn stood before the terminal, her fingers hovering over the interface as if it might bite her. The air was thick with ozone, the scent of something metallic clinging to her skin like a second layer. This place had always been a cathedral of memory, where the past was mined like ore, but tonight, it felt different. It felt alive, and that was a dangerous thing.

She had never truly understood the weight of what she did until now. Every day, she worked in the Memory Exchange, trading recollections like currency, watching people walk out with lighter minds and heavier hearts. She had always told herself it was necessary, that the system kept the city running, that without it, no one would live long enough to see the future. But that belief had always felt like a lie she had convinced herself to accept.

Now, standing in the heart of the Archive Vaults, Sága could feel the truth pressing against her chest like a vice. The rows of memory storage pods stretched in every direction, each one humming with the static of lives suspended in time—lives that had once been real, once belonged to people who had walked these halls, their identities fragmented and repurposed.

Her boots made no sound on the polished floor as she moved closer to the terminal. The cold glow of the data streams illuminated her face, casting sharp shadows across her features. She was not young anymore, though the years had never aged her in the traditional sense. Her body remained lean, her skin still smooth from the neural siphoning protocols that kept traders like her looking perpetually fresh. But her eyes—those dark, piercing eyes that had once been filled with purpose—now flickered with something she hadn’t felt in a long time: fear.

She had accessed the hidden folder by mistake—or perhaps not. The system had resisted her at first, its firewalls shifting like sand beneath her fingertips. She had spent years learning the language of data and silence, knowing how to navigate the labyrinthine architecture of the Memory Exchange. It was a skill that had kept her alive, that had allowed her to survive in a world where memories were more valuable than breath.

But tonight, she had done something different. Tonight, she had not traded. She had stolen.

The folder unraveled before her, revealing files with names that made no sense: *The First Erasure*, *Subject 007-Alpha*, *Echoing Heart Subroutine*. These were not memories meant for trade, nor even records of transactions. They were remnants—unaccounted fragments of lives that had been swallowed whole.

Her breath caught as she opened the first file. It wasn’t a memory in the traditional sense; it was a scene. A city, not Eterna Prime, but something older, more primitive. The skyline was jagged, unfinished, like the bones of a forgotten civilization. People stood in lines, their faces hollow, their eyes glazed with a kind of quiet resignation that made Sága’s stomach twist. It wasn’t just fear they felt—it was helplessness.

The air shimmered with something like static, and then the screen changed. It showed the process—neural siphoning machines descending upon individuals, extracting not just recollections, but entire consciousnesses. Those who resisted were silenced, their voices lost in the hum of the extraction coils. Their bodies remained, but their minds? Their identities? They were gone.

Sága’s hands trembled. This can’t be real… they’re not just erasing people, they’re imprisoning them in memories.

She leaned back from the screen, her mind racing. How many others had been taken like that? How many names had been erased from the city’s history, their lives reduced to bits and bytes stored in the dark corners of the Vaults? Her entire life had been built on the premise that memory was a currency, a trade, an exchange. But this—this was something else entirely.

Her internal conflict gnawed at her like a virus. She had always believed in the system, had justified its cruelty with the logic that it was necessary, that without it, no one would live long enough to see the future. But now, as she stared at the memory before her, she saw not a future, but a prison.

She closed the file and exhaled slowly, trying to steady herself. The truth had always been a risk, but this… this was something greater than any of them could have imagined. If she left this alone, if she turned away now, she would be complicit in the annihilation of countless souls.

No. She couldn’t do that.

The terminal blinked at her, waiting for her next command. Sága reached out and opened another file. This one was labeled *Project Genesis*. Inside were schematics of a city rising from the ruins of something else, its foundations built not on stone or steel, but on the very essence of human recollection. The Memory Exchange wasn’t just an institution—it was the core of Eterna Prime itself.

A new fear settled in her chest. If this was true, then they weren’t just trading memories. They were building a city on stolen identities, on forgotten souls. She had been a part of it all along.

She needed to copy this memory. To take it out. To show someone—anyone—that the system wasn’t what they thought it was.

The copying process was delicate. Neural siphoning was not something that could be done without consent, but she had bypassed the usual protocols.

The screen flickered, and for a moment, the memory seemed to resist her, as if aware of what she was doing.

Then, with a hiss of compressed air and the soft chime of a system override, the transfer began. She could feel the weight of the memory pressing against her mind, its presence a whisper on the edges of her consciousness. It wasn’t just data—it was *life*, fractured and frozen in time.

A red light flared above her head. Her heart leapt into her throat. The system had detected her unauthorized access.

*No. No. No.*

She yanked the crystal from the terminal, her pulse roaring in her ears. The alarm screeched through the Vaults, a shrill sound that echoed against the metallic walls like the wail of a lost soul. She ran, her boots pounding against the cold floor, past rows of memory storage pods that pulsed with stolen recollections.

I can’t let this go back into the system.

She ducked behind a shelf, pressing herself against the curved surface of a pod. A siphoning drone hovered nearby, its red eyes scanning the area with mechanical precision. It was designed to detect anomalies in the flow of memory data, to flag any unauthorized access before it could be transmitted beyond the Vaults. If it found her, if it detected the crystal she had just removed…

She swallowed hard, her mind racing through the labyrinthine corridors she had memorized over the years. There had to be a way out. She had come here with a plan, hadn’t she? A hidden route through maintenance tunnels, one that bypassed surveillance drones and automated sentinels.

Her breath came in ragged gasps as she pressed her back against the wall, heart pounding, mind reeling.

She had always thought herself efficient, detached. That was how you survived in the Memory Exchange. You didn’t let the memories get to you, didn’t let the weight of what you were doing settle in your bones. But now, every step she took felt like a betrayal, not just of the system, but of her own humanity.

She had seen what they were doing. She had touched it, held it in her hands. And she couldn’t turn away.

The tunnel opened into the lower districts of Eterna Prime, where the memory-lamps flickered weakly, their glow dimmed by the weight of the city’s collective loss. Her quarters were just a few blocks away, but every step felt like walking through a minefield. She was not just running from the system—she was running from herself.

She reached her door, breathless and trembling, and slid inside. The room was small, sterile, and illuminated by a single overhead light that buzzed faintly. It was the kind of place where memories were traded, not kept.

Lira stood in the center of the room, her face pale, her hands gripping the edge of the terminal as if it might anchor her to reality.

“They took my memory, Sága,” Lira said without looking up. “I don’t remember who I was.”

Sága’s throat tightened. She had not expected this. Not here. Not now. Her sister had always been a quiet presence, but in that moment, she felt like the weight of the world had settled on her shoulders.

“I didn’t think it would affect you too,” Sága replied, stepping forward cautiously. “I thought they’d just take the memory.”

Lira turned to face her, eyes wide with something between fear and confusion. “It wasn’t just a memory. It was *me*. I don’t know who I am anymore. I can’t remember my first day of school, or the way Mom used to laugh, or even your name.”

Sága’s heart stopped. She had known that the Memory Tax could be dangerous, but she had never imagined it would strip Lira of her very identity.

She reached out, hesitating for only a moment before taking her sister’s hand. “It’s not too late,” she said softly. “We can still find a way to get it back.”

Lira shook her head. “They don’t let you take back what they’ve taken. You’re supposed to just forget. To move on.”

Sága felt the words like a blade. She had taught Lira that, hadn’t she? Hadn’t she once told her that memories were just things to be traded, that it was better to lose one than to be burdened by them?

She didn’t have an answer now.

Instead, she pulled out the data crystal and placed it on the terminal. “This is what they’ve been hiding from us,” she said. “They’re not just trading memories, Lira. They’re erasing people. Whole lives.”

Lira stared at the crystal, then at Sága. “You saw it?” Her voice was barely a whisper.

“I did.” Sága nodded. “And I’m not going to let them do it anymore.”

She initiated the playback, and the memory unfolded before them like a wound being reopened. The city she had known all her life appeared in fragments—its spires built on human recollections, its systems sustained by stolen identities. And then, there was the final image: a group of people, their faces blurred, standing before a panel of figures who looked more like gods than humans.

Lira gasped as the memory played out. “I feel like I’m waking up from a dream,” she whispered, her fingers trembling against the edge of the terminal.

Sága watched her sister closely. She had always thought Lira was too young to understand the full weight of what they did. But now, with that memory burning in her eyes, Sága knew that wasn’t true. Lira had been watching all along, just like she had.

She reached out and touched her sister’s shoulder. “You’re not dreaming, Lira. This is real.”

The terminal blinked as the playback ended, and the room was suddenly too quiet. Lira looked at Sága with an expression that was both terrified and determined. It was a look that mirrored the one she had seen in herself just days ago.

“I remember now,” Lira said slowly. “I don’t know how, but I do. I remember feeling… something. Like there was more to me than what they wanted me to keep.”

Sága felt a flicker of hope. “Then we have to fight for it.”

Kael’s terminal buzzed with an incoming alert. The message appeared in red letters: *Unauthorized access detected—Subject Vorn, Sága. Locate and neutralize.* He stared at the screen, his fingers hovering over the keyboard as if unsure whether to hit delete or deny.

He had always been cautious. That was why he was still here, still working for the Guilds, still alive. But now, as the warning scrolled across his screen, he felt something shift in him. A memory from years ago surfaced unbidden: a client who had come in with a broken mind, begging to be allowed to keep just one more recollection before they took everything.

He had said no then. He had justified it. But what if that was the wrong choice?

You shouldn’t have gone there, Sága.

The words echoed in his mind as he typed a response, though he wasn’t sure who he was trying to convince—Sága, or himself.

“I didn’t think they’d find out so fast,” she had said. And now, here he was, watching the system flag her for something she hadn’t even finished doing.

He knew what would happen if the Enforcers caught her. They wouldn’t just erase her memories—they would erase *her*. She would become one of the Forgotten, wandering the Hollow Expanse with no recollection of who she once was.

The thought made his stomach twist.

Kael stood from his chair and walked to the window of his office, which overlooked the Memory Trade Square. He could see the city pulsing with its usual rhythm, but now it felt hollow. The people moved like ghosts, their faces lit by the glow of memory-lamps that held only fragments of their pasts.

He had always believed that the system was necessary, that without it, the city would fall into chaos. But what if the chaos wasn’t in the system itself, but in the way they used it? What if the Memory Exchange wasn’t a sanctuary for longevity, but a prison built on stolen recollections?

He turned back to his terminal and typed one final message: *I know what they’re doing. I just didn’t think I could do anything about it.*

It was the truth, and he knew that when Sága read it, she would understand that he wasn’t just warning her—he was reaching out.

The Memory Trade Square was a cacophony of voices, the hum of neural siphoning machines blending with the murmurs of traders and clients. Sága moved through the crowd as if she were invisible, the data crystal hidden in the folds of her coat. She had no intention of being seen, but the weight of what she carried made it hard to breathe.

She spotted Kael across the square, his face pale against the glow of the memory-lamps. He was watching her, and she could feel the unspoken warning in his gaze.

Kael stepped forward, his expression unreadable. “You shouldn’t have gone there, Sága.”

Her pulse quickened. “I didn’t think they’d find out so fast,” she said, keeping her voice low. “I thought I had more time.”

He shook his head slowly. “You don’t. They’re already looking for you. You’ve been flagged in the system.”

Sága’s fingers curled into fists. “Then I have to be careful. I can’t let them find me.”

Kael hesitated, then reached into his coat and pulled out a small device—a memory scanner, its surface dull with age. He held it out toward her. “You can’t run forever. They’ll catch you, Sága. And if they do, you won’t just lose your memories. You’ll be erased.”

Her breath caught in her throat. She had known the risk, but hearing it spoken aloud by Kael—by someone who had always been a part of the system—felt like a final confirmation that she was already too far gone.

“I’m not going to let them erase me,” she said, her voice steady. “Or anyone else.”

Kael’s eyes searched hers, and for a moment, he looked almost human. “Then you’re already marked for deletion.”

She didn’t flinch. “Maybe. But I’d rather be remembered than forgotten.”

He stepped closer, his voice barely above a whisper. “You don’t know what they’ll do to you if they find out what you’ve seen. They don’t just delete memories. They delete people.”

Sága looked down at the data crystal in her coat pocket. It was smaller than she expected, but it carried everything—the proof of their existence, the truth that had been buried for years.

“I know,” she said. “And I’m not going to let them keep it hidden.”

Kael exhaled sharply, his shoulders slumping slightly. “Then you’re going to be running for a long time. Longer than you think.”

She met his gaze. “I’ve already started.”

The Memory Trade Square was in chaos by the time Sága reached the maintenance area at the back of the center. A siphoning machine had malfunctioned, spewing sparks and static into the air. Traders shouted over one another, trying to salvage what they could from the mess. Clients stood frozen in confusion, their neural interfaces flickering erratically.

Sága ducked behind a row of broken machines, her heart pounding with the adrenaline of the escape. She had hidden the data crystal in a siphoning unit earlier, hoping it would be overlooked amid the chaos. But as she watched the machine sputter and fail, she knew she had made the right decision.

She reached into the machine’s core, pulling out the crystal and holding it tight in her palm. It was warm, pulsing with the same eerie energy that had filled her when she first accessed the forbidden memory. She could almost feel the lives within it, whispering their stories through the cold shell of data.

If I can’t hide it, I’ll destroy it.

She turned away from the machine, her eyes scanning the square for any sign of Enforcers. The malfunction had created a distraction, but she knew it wouldn’t last long. The system was too efficient, too well-oiled, to let such an error go unnoticed for long.

She slipped through the crowd, her mind racing with thoughts of what came next. She had seen the truth. She had given it to Lira. And now, she had Kael’s warning echoing in her ears.

The city was a lie. The Memory Exchange was not saving lives—it was consuming them. And she had seen the prison they built from those stolen souls.

She couldn’t go back to pretending. Not after this.

Sága moved through the lower districts, her steps measured but urgent. She knew that Kael would be watching for her, waiting for a sign that she was still alive. She needed to find him again—needed to share what she had seen, to make sure he understood the full scale of what they were dealing with.

She reached the maintenance facility beneath the city, where the air was thick with dust and the hum of old machinery. The walls were lined with rusted terminals, their screens flickering with outdated data. It was a place that had been long abandoned, forgotten by the system that now governed everything.

Kael was already there, standing in the center of the room, his face drawn, his posture tense. He looked up as she entered, his eyes narrowing slightly before softening into something that almost resembled relief.

“You made it,” he said, his voice low.

She nodded, her hands still clenched around the crystal. “I didn’t have much choice.”

Kael took a step closer, his gaze flicking to the device in her hand. “That’s not just a memory, is it?”

Sága hesitated, then reached into her coat and placed it on the terminal. The screen flickered as she initiated the playback. The forbidden memory unfolded before them once more, its images sharp and painful this time, as if she had seen them too many times already.

Kael watched in silence, his jaw tight, his hands gripping the edge of the table. He had always suspected something was wrong with the system, but seeing it in full—seeing the way they built a city on stolen recollections, on human consciousness reduced to data fragments—was something else entirely.

“This isn’t just control,” he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. “It’s annihilation.”

Sága met his gaze. “I know.”

He looked away, as if the weight of it was too much to bear. “I wanted to believe they were just controlling memories,” he admitted, his voice rough with emotion. “That they were trying to keep things stable, that they had a reason for what they do. But now I see the truth. And I’m not sure I can turn back.”

Sága stepped forward, her hand resting lightly on his shoulder. “You don’t have to turn back. You can help me stop them.”

Kael’s eyes flicked back to hers, and for a moment, she saw something in them that had never been there before—conviction. A spark of rebellion.

“We have to expose this,” he said. “But how?”

She hesitated, her mind racing through the possibilities. The Memory Exchange was too tightly controlled, too many eyes watching every move. If they tried to go public, it would be like shouting into a void. But maybe there were other ways—other people who had seen the truth, who had felt the weight of stolen identities.

“There are others,” she said slowly. “People who have questioned the system before. People who remember what it was like before the Guilds took over.”

Kael’s expression darkened. “You’re saying they’re still out there? That they haven’t been erased?”

Sága shook her head. “Some of them. I think. I’ve seen glimpses of their memories, buried in the Archives. They were trying to stop this before it started. And now, I’m going to finish what they couldn’t.”

Kael exhaled sharply, his fingers tightening around the edge of the terminal. “That’s dangerous, Sága. More than you know.”

She nodded. “I know. But we don’t have a choice anymore.”

Before he could respond, the sound of heavy boots echoed through the facility. The red light of an Enforcer’s scanner flared in the corridor beyond the door.

Kael turned sharply, his eyes wide. “They’re coming.”

Sága felt her heart drop. She had hoped for more time, more planning, but the system was already closing in.

“We don’t have much time,” she said, gripping the crystal tightly. “We need to find a way out—before they catch us.”

Kael’s face was grim. “They’ll find us. They always do.”

Sága stepped forward, her voice steady. “Then we make sure they don’t take anything else from us.”

She looked at him, and for the first time since she had discovered the truth, she felt something other than fear—hope.

Hope that maybe, just maybe, they could change everything. That they could fight back against a system built on stolen souls.

Kael met her gaze, then nodded slowly. “Then we fight.”

The sound of metal grinding against metal filled the air as the Enforcer’s boots neared. Sága turned to the terminal, her fingers flying across the interface. She needed to erase their trail, to make sure they didn’t know where she had been.

She would not be erased. Not again.

Not this time.
