The neon signs flickered like dying stars as Sága stepped into the alleyway, her boots crunching over broken glass. The Outskirts had always been a place of whispers and shadows, where the city’s grip loosened just enough for secrets to fester in the dark. She adjusted the strap of her satchel, the memory siphon inside humming faintly with stored energy. Her hands were steady, but her mind was not. This job was different. The request form had said so—*“Client will not be trading anything.”* That alone should have raised red flags. But she had no choice. The Memory Exchange paid well, and the credits she earned kept her alive.

She moved quickly, past the skeletal remains of buildings that had long since stopped breathing. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and rust. Here, the city’s surveillance drones hovered too far above to see her, their red eyes blinking lazily as if they had given up on this place. Sága exhaled, her breath curling in the cold night. She had done this before—delivered siphons, collected memories, traded them for time. But never had she been sent to someone who refused to trade.

The house stood at the end of the alley, its windows shattered and its door slightly ajar. A single light bulb flickered above the entrance, casting jagged shadows across the cracked pavement. No sign of life. She hesitated only for a moment before stepping inside.

The air was stale, heavy with dust and something else—something that made her skin prickle. She moved through the darkened hallway, her fingers brushing against the walls, feeling the rough texture of peeling paint and dry rot. The silence was thick, broken only by the distant creak of metal and the faintest whisper that echoed from deeper inside the house.

“No one’s here... but the door was open.”

She pushed forward, past a living room where furniture sat like forgotten ghosts. Her eyes caught on a small table covered in scattered notes, their edges yellowed with age. One word repeated itself in jagged handwriting: *Vault.* She frowned. The Memory Vault wasn’t just a place—it was a myth, a whispered legend among those who had heard too much and remembered too little.

She found the hidden room behind a false wall, its entrance concealed by a loose panel of wood that groaned as she pried it open. Inside, the air smelled of old paper and something more electric, like static before a storm. The room was small, almost claustrophobic, lined with shelves holding memory siphons—some broken, some still humming faintly. In the center stood a large, rusted device that looked like a cross between a machine and a tomb.

“This place was used for something more than just trading.”

She ran her fingers over the notes scattered across a desk, their content disjointed but filled with urgency. One read: *The Vault remembers what we choose to forget.* Another had a crude sketch of the Walled City, with an arrow pointing toward its heart and a label that said *Vault Access Point.*

Sága’s pulse quickened. She had heard rumors about the Vault, but never had she thought it would be real. Or if it was, that someone had left behind this trail of breadcrumbs.

She found a siphon still intact, its sleek metal casing warm to the touch. As she activated it, a soft hum filled the room, and for a moment, the air seemed to shimmer like heat rising from pavement. Then, a holographic message appeared in the center of the room: *The Vault is not for the living.*

Her breath caught. She had never seen this siphon before. It wasn’t one used by the Exchange—it was something else. A key.

She followed the signal it emitted, which led her through the underbelly of the Walled City, past forgotten corridors and sealed-off tunnels. The deeper she went, the more the city seemed to close around her, as if it knew what she was doing and didn’t want her to find out.

At last, she reached a massive door hidden beneath layers of concrete and old scaffolding. It pulsed faintly, like a heartbeat. She pressed the siphon against the surface, and with a low hum, the door groaned open, revealing a dark passage that led downward into the earth.

“I shouldn’t be here... but I need to know.”

The air inside was colder than outside, carrying the scent of something ancient and preserved. The walls were lined with orbs of light, each one pulsing softly like a trapped star. She stepped forward, her heart pounding in her chest, and saw them—memories suspended in time. Not just fragments, but entire lives, frozen in moments that should have been fleeting.

“These aren’t just memories—they’re people.”

She reached out, her fingers brushing against the nearest orb. A child’s laughter filled the chamber, clear and bright, untouched by the city’s rules. She saw a mother holding the child, smiling as if it were the last day of forever. Then, the image shattered into static, leaving only silence.

A memory played next—this time, one she recognized. Her friend, Lir, standing in the middle of a street, his eyes wide with something that looked like fear. The image was grainy, but Sága could see the desperation in his face.

“I never thought about what happened to them.”

The memory showed Lir being led away by two figures in black, their faces obscured. She saw him struggle, his voice pleading, but no one answered. The last thing she saw was Lir disappearing into the Vault’s depths, his fate sealed before he could even speak.

She stumbled back, her breath ragged. The truth had never been about extending life—it was about control, about erasure. And she had spent years helping them do it.

“I’ve been complicit in this... all along.”

The chamber around her seemed to pulse with the weight of every forgotten life. She could feel their presence, their memories pressing against her like a tide. She thought of the people who had traded their pasts for more time, unaware that they were trading something far more valuable.

A whisper echoed through the Vault: *What if I could change it?*

She didn’t know how, but she knew she would try.

“I can’t ignore this anymore.”

She took one last look at the orbs before stepping back into the dark corridor. The Vault’s doors closed behind her with a finality that sent a shiver down her spine. She clutched the siphon tightly, its weight now more than just metal and wires—it was a promise.

“The truth is worth more than my life.”

As she emerged from the underground passage and stepped back into the Walled City, everything felt different. The streets, once familiar, now seemed oppressive, their towering buildings casting long shadows over those who moved beneath them. She had seen what the Memory Exchange truly was. And no longer could she pretend not to know.

“I can’t keep pretending I don’t know.”

She walked through the city’s lower district, where the air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. The café she had once frequented stood at the corner, its lights dim and its patrons hushed. She stepped inside, the door creaking as if it hadn’t been opened in years.

Anya looked up from her table, her eyes narrowing as they landed on Sága. “You’ve changed,” she said, voice barely above a whisper.

“I’ve seen things,” Sága replied, sliding into the seat across from her. “And I can’t go back to pretending they don’t exist.”

Anya’s fingers tightened around her cup. “You don’t have to trade. You can choose.”

“But what if I already lost that choice?”

Anya didn’t answer. She simply looked away, as if afraid of what she might say.

Sága left the café with more questions than answers. The Memory Exchange had given her time—time to live another day, another week, another year. But now, she saw it for what it truly was: a system built on sacrifice, on forgetting, on control.

She would find out what else was buried in the Vault. And this time, she wouldn’t be silent.

“I will find a way to stop this.”
